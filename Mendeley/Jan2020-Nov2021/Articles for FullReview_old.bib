   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic with high morbidity and mortality rates. Current epidemiological studies urge the need of implementing sophisticated methods to appraise the evolution of COVID-19. In this study, we analysed the data for 228 days (1 May to 15 December 2020) of daily incidence of COVID-19 cases for a district level analysis in the region of Jammu and Kashmir in the northern Himalayan belt of India. We used a deep learning-based incremental learning technique to model the current trend of COVID-19 transmission and to predict the future trends with 60-day forecasting. The results not only indicate high rates of morbidity and mortality but also forecast high rise in the incidence of COVID-19 in different districts of the study region. We used geographic information system (GIS) for storing, analysing, and presenting the spread of COVID-19 which provides key insights in understanding, planning, and implementing mitigating measures to tackle the current spread of the pandemic and its possible future scenarios. The existing disparity in health care facilities at district level is shown in relation to the spread of disease. The study results also highlight the need to upgrade health care infrastructure in the study region to control the current and future pandemics. These results could be useful for administration and scientific community to develop efficient short-term and long-term strategies against such diseases.},

   abstract = {Background: Time-series forecasting has a critical role during pandemics as it provides essential information that can lead to abstaining from the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is spreading rapidly all over the world. The countries with dense populations, in particular, such as India, await imminent risk in tackling the epidemic. Different forecasting models are being used to predict future cases of COVID-19. The predicament for most of them is that they are not able to capture both the linear and nonlinear features of the data solely. Methods: We propose an ensemble model integrating an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR). ARIMA models are used to extract the linear correlations and the NAR neural network for modeling the residuals of ARIMA containing nonlinear components of the data. Comparison: Single ARIMA model, ARIMA-NAR model and few other existing models which have been applied on the COVID-19 data in different countries are compared based on performance evaluation parameters. Result: The hybrid combination displayed significant reduction in RMSE (16.23%), MAE (37.89%) and MAPE (39.53%) values when compared with single ARIMA model for daily observed cases. Similar results with reduced error percentages were found for daily reported deaths and cases of recovery as well. RMSE value of our hybrid model was lesser in comparison to other models used for forecasting COVID-19 in different countries. Conclusion: Results suggested the effectiveness of the new hybrid model over a single ARIMA model in capturing the linear as well as nonlinear patterns of the COVID-19 data.},

Modeling results stipulate that the mortality rate increase as the age increase and it is found that most of the death cases belong to the age group 60–80. Cluster-based analysis of age groups is also conducted to analyze the maximum targeted age-groups. An association between positive COVID-19 cases and deceased cases are also presented, with the impact on male and female death cases due to corona. Additionally, we have also presented an artificial intelligence-based statistical approach to predict the survival chances of corona infected people in South Korea with the analysis of the impact on the exploratory factors, including age-groups, gender, temporal evolution, etc. To analyze the coronavirus cases, we applied machine learning with hyperparameters tuning and deep learning models with an autoencoder-based approach for estimating the influence of the disparate features on the spread of the disease and predict the survival possibilities of the quarantined patients in isolation. The model calibrated in the study is based on positive corona infection cases and presents the analysis over different aspects that proven to be impactful to analyze the temporal trends in the current situation along with the exploration of deceased cases due to coronavirus.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Mathematical modeling of vector-borne diseases and forecasting of epidemics outbreak are global challenges and big point of concern worldwide. The outbreaks depend on different social and demographic factors based on human mobility structured with the help of mathematical models for vector-borne disease transmission. In Dec 2019, an infectious disease is known as "coronavirus" (officially declared as COVID-19 by WHO) emerged in Wuhan (Capital city of Hubei, China) and spread quickly to all over the china with over 50,000 cases including more than 1000 death within a short period of one month. Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. OBJECTIVES The main objective of this proposed hybrid computing technique are as follows: The innovative design of the NAR-RBFs neural network paradigm is designed to construct the SITR epidemic differential equation (DE) model to ascertain the different features of the spread of COVID-19. The new set of transformations is introduced for nonlinear input to achieve with a higher level of accuracy, stability, and convergence analysis. METHODS Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. In this research bimodal spread of COVID-19 is investigated with hybrid model based on nonlinear autoregressive with radial base function (NAR-RBFs) neural network for SITR model. Chaotic and stochastic data of the pandemic. A new class of transformation is presented for the system of ordinary differential equation (ODE) for fast convergence and improvement of desired accuracy level. The proposed transformations convert local optimum values to global values before implementation of bimodal paradigm. RESULTS This suggested NAR-RBFs model is investigated for the bi-module nature of SITR model with additional feature of fragility in modeling of stochastic variation ability for different cases and scenarios with constraints variation. Best agreement of the proposed bimodal paradigm with outstanding numerical solver is confirmed based on statistical results calculated from MSE, RMSE and MAPE with accuracy level based on mean square error up to 1E-25, which further validates the stability and consistence of bimodal proposed model. CONCLUSIONS This computational technique is shown extraordinary results in terms of accuracy and convergence. The outcomes of this study will be useful in forecasting the progression of COVID-19, the influence of several deciding parameters overspread of COVID-19 and can help for planning, monitoring as well as preventing the spread of COVID-19.},

Recently, a forecasting model was developed to measure and predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia on daily basis for the next 10 days using previously-confirmed cases. A Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) is proposed by establishing L and <italic>ET</italic> parameters via several tests. The advantage of using this forecasting model is it would discriminate noise in a time series trend and produce significant forecasting results.

These results revealed that parameter <italic>L</italic> = 5 (T/20) for the RF-SSA model was indeed suitable for short-time series outbreak data, while the appropriate number of eigentriples was integral as it influenced the forecasting results. Evidently, the RF-SSA had over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This signifies the competence of RF-SSA in predicting the impending number of COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, an enhanced RF-SSA algorithm should be developed for higher effectivity of capturing any extreme data changes. </p>},

   abstract = {This generation faces existential threats because of the global assault of the novel Corona virus 2019 (i.e., COVID-19). With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on “flattening the curve”. While medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity. Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and, particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is effective in performing a rapid and consistent Corona virus diagnosis that is primarily aimed at assisting clinicians in making accurate identification of the virus.},

   abstract = {Background: Understanding the pattern of COVID-19 infection progression is critical for health policymakers. Reaching the exponential peak of cases, flattening the curve, and treating all of the active cases are the keys to success in reducing outbreak transmission. The objective of this study was to determine the most effective model for predicting the peak of COVID-19 in Indonesia, using a deterministic model. Methods: The SEI2RS model considers five strategies for control, namely: large-scale social restriction (u1), contact tracing (u2), mass testing (u3), case detection and treatment (u4), and the wearing of face masks (u5). Three scenarios were developed, each differentiated by the controls. The model used April 10, 2020, and December 31, 2020, as the initial and final times. Results: The simulation results indicated that the peak of COVID-19 cases for scenarios 1, 2, and 3 occur on the 59th day with 33,151 cases, on the 38th day with 37,908 cases, and on the 40th day with 39,305 cases. For all of the scenarios, the decline phase shows a slow downward slope and about 8000 cases of COVID-19 still active by the end of 2020. Conclusion: The study concludes that scenario 2, which consists of large-scale social restriction (u1), contact tracing (u2), case detection and treatment (u4), and the wearing of face masks (u5), is the most rational scenario to control COVID-19 spreading in Indonesia.},

Unlike other forecasting techniques, our proposed approach first groups the countries having similar demographic and socioeconomic aspects and health sector indicators using K-means clustering algorithm. The cumulative case data of the clustered countries enriched with data related to the lockdown measures are fed to the bidirectional LSTM to train the forecasting model.

Although the comparison between countries is essential for controlling this disease, the main challenge is the fact of countries are not simultaneously affected by the virus. Therefore, from the COVID-19 dataset by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, we present a temporal analysis on the number of new cases and deaths among countries using artificial intelligence. Our approach incrementally models the cases using a hierarchical clustering that emphasizes country transitions between infection groups over time. Then, one can compare the current situation of a country against others that have already faced previous waves. By using our approach, we designed a transition index to estimate the most probable countries' movements between infectious groups to predict next wave trends. We draw two important conclusions: (1) we show the historical infection path taken by specific countries and emphasize changing points that occur when countries move between clusters with small, medium, or large number of cases; (2) we estimate new waves for specific countries using the transition index.},

Several forecasting models have been developed based on the data acquired within the early stages of the virus spread. However, with the recent emergence of new virus variants, it is unclear how the new strains could influence the efficiency of forecasting using models adopted using earlier data. In this study, we analyzed daily positive cases (DPC) data using a machine learning model to understand the effect of new viral variants on morbidity rates. A deep learning model that considers several environmental and mobility factors was used to forecast DPC in six districts of Japan. From machine learning predictions with training data since the early days of COVID-19, high-quality estimation has been achieved for data obtained earlier than March 2021. However, a significant upsurge was observed in some districts after the discovery of the new COVID-19 variant B.1.1.7 (Alpha). An average increase of 20–40% in DPC was observed after the emergence of the Alpha variant and an increase of up to 20% has been recognized in the effective reproduction number. Approximately four weeks was needed for the machine learning model to adjust the forecasting error caused by the new variants. The comparison between machine-learning predictions and reported values demonstrated that the emergence of new virus variants should be considered within COVID-19 forecasting models. This study presents an easy yet efficient way to quantify the change caused by new viral variants with potential usefulness for global data analysis.},

Model considers two forms of spread: when the spread takes time after infecting one person and when the spread is immediate after infecting one person.

The proposed diffusion prediction model forecasts the number of new cases expected to occur in next 4 weeks. The model has predicted the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and active cases. The model can facilitate government to be well prepared for any abrupt rise in this pandemic. The performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and error rate and compared with the prediction results of support vector machine, logistic regression model and convolution neural network.

We train this algorithm with historical data, including medical history, demographic data, as well as COVID-19-related information. This is extracted from a database of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections in Mexico, constituting the official COVID-19 data compiled and made publicly available by the Mexican Federal Government. We demonstrate that the proposed method can detect high-risk patients with high accuracy, in each of four identified clinical stages, thus improving hospital capacity planning and timely treatment. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to provide optimal estimators for hypothesis-testing techniques commonly-used in biological and medical statistics.

In this paper, a different approach has been discussed, which is the development of predictive models for the SEIRD variables that have been based on the historical data collected, and the context variables to where this model has been applied to. Particularly, the context variables examined in this paper include total population, number of people over 65 years old, poverty index, morbidity rates, average age, and population density. For the construction of the SEIRD predictive models, this study encompasses a deep analysis of the dependence of these variables and also, their relationship with the context variables. Hence, before the development of predictive models using machine learning techniques, a methodology to analyze the interdependence of the SEIRD variables has been proposed. The dependence with the context variables is also discussed; to avoid the curse of dimensionality and multicollinearity problems, leading to better results and the reduction of the computational cost. Finally, several prediction models based on varied machine learning techniques and inputs are considered, these include temporal interdependence, temporal intra-dependence, and dependence with context variables. Each of the predictive models has been studied, as well as their quality of prediction. This paper focuses on the analysis of the quality of this approach, applied in Colombia, obtaining the results about the performance of the predictive models for the SEIRD variables. The results are very encouraging since the values obtained with the quality metrics are quite good for different prediction horizons.},

   abstract = {In this study, we developed and analyzed a mathematical model for explaining the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India. The proposed (Formula presented.) model is a modified version of the existing (Formula presented.) model. Our model divides the infected class (Formula presented.) of (Formula presented.) model into two classes: (Formula presented.) (unknown infected class) and (Formula presented.) (known infected class). In addition, we consider (Formula presented.) a recovered and reserved class, where susceptible people can hide them due to fear of the COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, a non-monotonic incidence function is deemed to incorporate the psychological effect of the novel coronavirus diseases on India's community. The epidemiological threshold parameter, namely the basic reproduction number, has been formulated and presented graphically. With this threshold parameter, the local and global stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic proportion equilibrium based on disease persistence have been analyzed. Lastly, numerical results of long-run prediction using MATLAB show that the fate of this situation is very harmful if people are not following the guidelines issued by the authority.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a major pandemic threat that has spread to more than 212 countries with more than 432,902 recorded deaths and 7,898,442 confirmed cases worldwide so far (on June 14, 2020). It is crucial to investigate the spatial drivers to prevent and control the epidemic of COVID-19. Methods: This is the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 in Iran; and it carries out spatial modeling, risk mapping, change detection, and outbreak trend analysis of the disease spread. Four main steps were taken: comparison of Iranian coronavirus data with the global trends, prediction of mortality trends using regression modeling, spatial modeling, risk mapping, and change detection using the random forest (RF) machine learning technique (MLT), and validation of the modeled risk map. Results: The results show that from February 19 to June 14, 2020, the average growth rates (GR) of COVID-19 deaths and the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran were 1.08 and 1.10, respectively. Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) data, Iran's fatality rate (deaths/0.1 M pop) is 10.53. Other countries' fatality rates were, for comparison, Belgium – 83.32, UK – 61.39, Spain – 58.04, Italy – 56.73, Sweden – 48.28, France – 45.04, USA – 35.52, Canada – 21.49, Brazil – 20.10, Peru – 19.70, Chile – 16.20, Mexico– 12.80, and Germany – 10.58. The fatality rate for China is 0.32 (deaths/0.1 M pop). Over time, the heatmap of the infected areas identified two critical time intervals for the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. The provinces were classified in terms of disease and death rates into a large primary group and three provinces that had critical outbreaks were separate from the others. The heatmap of countries of the world shows that China and Italy were distinguished from other countries in terms of nine viral infection-related parameters. The regression models for death cases showed an increasing trend but with some evidence of turning. A polynomial relationship was identified between the coronavirus infection rate and the province population density. Also, a third-degree polynomial regression model for deaths showed an increasing trend recently, indicating that subsequent measures taken to cope with the outbreak have been insufficient and ineffective. The general trend of deaths in Iran is similar to the world's, but Iran's shows lower volatility. Change detection of COVID-19 risk maps with a random forest model for the period from March 11 to March 18 showed an increasing trend of COVID-19 in Iran's provinces. It is worth noting that using the LASSO MLT to evaluate variables' importance, indicated that the most important variables were the distance from bus stations, bakeries, hospitals, mosques, ATMs (automated teller machines), banks, and the minimum temperature of the coldest month. Conclusions: We believe that this study's risk maps are the primary, fundamental step to take for managing and controlling COVID-19 in Iran and its provinces.},

   abstract = {Background: The inherent difficulty of identifying and monitoring emerging outbreaks caused by novel pathogens can lead to their rapid spread; and if left unchecked, they may become major public health threats to the planet. The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, which has infected over 2,300,000 individuals and caused over 150,000 deaths, is an example of one of these catastrophic events. Objective: We present a timely and novel methodology that combines disease estimates from mechanistic models and digital traces, via interpretable machine learning methodologies, to reliably forecast COVID-19 activity in Chinese provinces in real time. Methods: Our method uses the following as inputs: (a) official health reports, (b) COVID-19-related internet search activity, (c) news media activity, and (d) daily forecasts of COVID-19 activity from a metapopulation mechanistic model. Our machine learning methodology uses a clustering technique that enables the exploitation of geospatial synchronicities of COVID-19 activity across Chinese provinces and a data augmentation technique to deal with the small number of historical disease observations characteristic of emerging outbreaks. Results: Our model is able to produce stable and accurate forecasts 2 days ahead of the current time and outperforms a collection of baseline models in 27 out of 32 Chinese provinces. Conclusions: Our methodology could be easily extended to other geographies currently affected by COVID-19 to aid decision makers with monitoring and possibly prevention.},

As the virus sparked local epidemics in new communities, health systems and policy makers were forced to make decisions with limited information about the spread of the disease. We developed a compartmental model to project COVID-19 healthcare demands that combined information regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics from international reports with local COVID-19 hospital census data to support response efforts in three metropolitan statistical areas in Texas, USA: Austin-Round Rock, Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, and Beaumont-Port Arthur. Our model projects that strict stay-home orders and other social distancing measures could suppress the spread of the pandemic. Our capacity to provide rapid decision-support in response to emerging threats depends on access to data, validated modeling approaches, careful uncertainty quantification, and adequate computational resources.},

   abstract = {To inform data-driven decisions in fighting the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, this research develops a spatiotemporal analysis framework under the combination of an ensemble model (random forest regression) and a multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II). It has been verified for four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, and Nepal. Accordingly, we can gain some valuable experience to better understand the disease evolution, forecast the prevalence of the disease, which can provide sustainable evidence to guide further intervention and management. Random forest with a proper rolling time-window can learn the combined effects of environmental and social factors to accurately predict the daily growth of confirmed cases and daily death rate on a national scale, which is followed by NSGA-II to find a range of Pareto optimal solutions for ensuring the minimization of the infection rate and mortality at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate that the predictive model can alert the local government in advance, allowing the accused time to put forward relevant measures. The temperature in the category of environment and the stringency index belonging to the social factor are identified as the top 2 important features to exert a greater impact on the virus transmission. Moreover, optimal solutions provide references to design the best control strategies towards pandemic containment and prevention that can accommodate the country-specific circumstance, which are possible to decrease the two objectives by more than 95%. In particular, appropriate adjustment of social-related features needs to take priority over others, since it can bring about at least 1.47% average improvement of two objectives compared to environmental factors.},

We approached the prediction from a new perspective that is inspired by transfer learning and feature engineering approaches widely adopted in machine learning. We trained the model to learn COVID-19 pattern cues of other countries such as South Africa, Senegal, Slovenia, Australia, Belgium, and Israel with sufficient and recorded infection cases and test count as baseline data; and created additional features to increase the model's predictive power. With a testing capacity of 2000 persons per day in Nigeria, the cumulative infection counts for 30-04-2020, 15-05-2020, and 22-05-2020 were predicted to rise to 3044, 5622, and 7254 respectively.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and differential impacts on metropolitan areas across the United States and around the world. Within the United States, metropolitan areas that were hit earliest with the pandemic and reacted with scientifically based health policy were able to contain the virus by late spring. For other areas that kept businesses open, the first wave in the United States hit in mid-summer. As the weather turns colder, universities resume classes, and people tire of lockdowns, a second wave is ascending in both metropolitan and rural areas. It becomes more obvious that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed at the local level to track recent shifts in the pandemic, rates of increase, and persistence. Objective: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, and weekly shifts, to better understand and manage risk in metropolitan areas. Existing surveillance measures coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until, and after, an effective vaccine is developed. Here, we provide values for novel indicators to measure COVID-19 transmission at the metropolitan area level. Methods: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 260 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the 25 largest US metropolitan areas as a function of the prior number of cases and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. Results: Minneapolis and Chicago have the greatest average number of daily new positive results per standardized 100,000 population (which we refer to as speed). Extreme behavior in Minneapolis showed an increase in speed from 17 to 30 (67%) in 1 week. The jerk and acceleration calculated for these areas also showed extreme behavior. The dynamic panel data model shows that Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit have the largest persistence effects, meaning that new cases pertaining to a specific week are statistically attributable to new cases from the prior week. Conclusions: Three of the metropolitan areas with historically early and harsh winters have the highest persistence effects out of the top 25 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States at the beginning of their cold weather season. With these persistence effects, and with indoor activities becoming more popular as the weather gets colder, stringent COVID-19 regulations will be more important than ever to flatten the second wave of the pandemic. As colder weather grips more of the nation, southern metropolitan areas may also see large spikes in the number of cases.},

   abstract = {Globally, many research works are going on to study the infectious nature of COVID-19 and every day we learn something new about it through the flooding of the huge data that are accumulating hourly rather than daily which instantly opens hot research avenues for artificial intelligence researchers. However, the public's concern by now is to find answers for two questions; (1) When this COVID-19 pandemic will be over? and (2) After coming to its end, will COVID-19 return again in what is known as a second rebound of the pandemic? In this work, we developed a predictive model that can estimate the expected period that the virus can be stopped and the risk of the second rebound of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have considered the SARIMA model to predict the spread of the virus on several selected countries and used it for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic life cycle and its end. The study can be applied to predict the same for other countries as the nature of the virus is the same everywhere. The proposed model investigates the statistical estimation of the slowdown period of the pandemic which is extracted based on the concept of normal distribution. The advantages of this study are that it can help governments to act and make sound decisions and plan for future so that the anxiety of the people can be minimized and prepare the mentality of people for the next phases of the pandemic. Based on the experimental results and simulation, the most striking finding is that the proposed algorithm shows the expected COVID-19 infections for the top countries of the highest number of confirmed cases will be manifested between Dec-2020 and Apr-2021. Moreover, our study forecasts that there may be a second rebound of the pandemic in a year time if the currently taken precautions are eased completely. We have to consider the uncertain nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the growing inter-connected and complex world, that are ultimately demanding flexibility, robustness and resilience to cope with the unexpected future events and scenarios.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is a worldwide transmitted pandemic that has brought a threatening challenge to Indian society and the economy. The disease has become a public health disaster, which has no effective medication. However, proper management and planning, which includes understanding the transmitting pattern, number of containment zones, vulnerable factors, and level of risk, may break the chain of transmission and reduce the number of cases. Hence, this study has attempted to model the COVID-19 vulnerability using an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, namely fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for West Bengal, India, through geographic information system (GIS). A total of 15 parameters were utilised to model the COVID-19 vulnerability, which was further categorised into three criteria: social vulnerability, epidemiological vulnerability, and physical vulnerability. The final vulnerability mapping has been done using these three criteria through the GIS platform. This study reveals that COVID-19 infection highly threatens about 20% of the total area of West Bengal, 23.42% moderately vulnerable, and 57.03% of the area comes under low vulnerability. The highly vulnerable region includes the Kolkata, South 24 Paraganas, and North 24 Paraganas, which are considered highly populated districts of West Bengal. Therefore government agencies should be more focused and plan accordingly to safeguard the community, especially the region with very high COVID-19 vulnerability, from further spreading the infection.},

   abstract = {After the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concen, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation, or attack strategies. This Manuscript was originally written in the last days of March as a way to report on the first current wave of the pandemic. The results were updated several times for March and also for the month of July. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to reported infected populations at the beginning of the first peak of the pandemic to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the individual regions (CCAA). The aim of this model it's to evaluate the confinement rate at the first stages of the epidemic outbreak in order to assess the scenarios that minimize the incidence but also the mortality. Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follow an evolution similar to the isolation of 1,5 percent of the population, and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum of over 1.4M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents a 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid and Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than a half the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre-and post-intervention also begins to suggest a substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions. By last we show the real evolution of the pandemic up to the end of May and the beginning of July in order to calculate the real confinement rate from data to compare with the scenarios formulated at March.},

   abstract = {Recently, various countries from across the globe have been facing the second wave of COVID-19 infections. In order to understand the dynamics of the spread of the disease, much effort has been made in terms of mathematical modeling. In this scenario, compartmental models are widely used to simulate epidemics under various conditions. In general, there are uncertainties associated with the reported data, which must be considered when estimating the parameters of the model. In this work, we propose an effective methodology for estimating parameters of compartmental models in multiple wave scenarios by means of a dynamic data segmentation approach. This robust technique allows the description of the dynamics of the disease without arbitrary choices for the end of the first wave and the start of the second. Furthermore, we adopt a time-dependent function to describe the probability of transmission by contact for each wave. We also assess the uncertainties of the parameters and their influence on the simulations using a stochastic strategy. In order to obtain realistic results in terms of the basic reproduction number, a constraint is incorporated into the problem. We adopt data from Germany and Italy, two of the first countries to experience the second wave of infections. Using the proposed methodology, the end of the first wave (and also the start of the second wave) occurred on 166 and 187 days from the beginning of the epidemic, for Germany and Italy, respectively. The estimated effective reproduction number for the first wave is close to that obtained by other approaches, for both countries. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is able to find good estimates for all parameters. In relation to uncertainties, we show that slight variations in the design variables can give rise to significant changes in the value of the effective reproduction number. The results provide information on the characteristics of the epidemic for each country, as well as elements for decision-making in the economic and governmental spheres.},

Therefore, these modeling tools have been widely used in epidemiology for predicting risks and decision-making processes. The purpose of this paper is to provide an effective mathematical model for predicting the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.
Methods: Our mathematical model is performed according to a SIDR model for infectious diseases. Epidemiological data from four countries; Belgium, Morocco, Netherlands and Russia, are used to validate this model. Also, we have evaluated the efficiency of Morocco's Covid-19 countermeasures and simulated the different relaxation plans in order to predict the effects of relaxation countermeasures.
Results and conclusions: In this paper, we developed and validated a new way of data aggregation, modeling and interpretation to predict the spread of Covid-19, evaluate the efficiency of countermeasures and suggest potential scenarios. Our results will be used to keep the spread of Covid-19 under control in the world.

In an environment where behavioral patterns and physical contacts are constantly evolving according to new governmental regulations, measuring these interactions is a major challenge. Mobility has emerged as an indicator for human activity and, implicitly, for human interactions. Here, we study the coupling between mobility and COVID-19 dynamics and show that variations in global air traffic and local driving mobility can be used to stratify different disease phases. For ten European countries, our study shows a maximal correlation between driving mobility and disease dynamics with a time lag of 14.6 ± 5.6 days.

In general, statistical data collected as cumulative and epidemic curves are a superposition of many distinct local pandemic waves. In our modeling, we use the system of Feigenbaum's discrete logistic equations (a logistic map) that describes the variation of the total number of infected over time. We show that this is the optimal model for the description of pandemic propagation in open nonhomogeneous systems with large errors in statistical data. We develop a procedure for isolating local waves, determining their model parameters, and predicting further evolution of each wave. We show that this model provides a good description of the statistical data and makes realistic forecasts. The forecast horizon depends on the degree of system closure and homogeneity.

A particular attention is paid to interrelation of I(t) and R(t) both depending on α/β, where α is the contact rate in the community and β is the intensity of recovery/decease of patients.

   abstract = {Mathematical and computational models are useful tools for virtual policy experiments on infectious disease control. Most models fail to provide flexible and rapid simulation of various epidemic scenarios for policy assessment. This paper establishes a multi-scale agent-based model to investigate the infectious disease propagation between cities and within a city using the knowledge from person-to-person transmission. In the model, the contact and infection of individuals at the micro scale where an agent represents a person provide insights for the interactions of agents at the meso scale where an agent refers to hundreds of individuals. Four cities with frequent population movements in China are taken as an example and actual data on traffic patterns and demographic parameters are adopted. The scenarios for dynamic propagation of infectious disease with no external measures are compared versus the scenarios with vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions. The model predicts that the peak of infections will decline by 67.37% with 80% vaccination rate, compared to a drop of 89.56% when isolation and quarantine measures are also in place. The results highlight the importance of controlling the source of infection by isolation and quarantine throughout the epidemic. We also study the effect when cities implement inconsistent public health interventions, which is common in practical situations. Based on our results, the model can be applied to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases according to the various needs of government agencies.},

   abstract = {Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic is considered a major threat to global public health. The aim of our study was to use the official epidemiological data to forecast the epidemic curves (daily new cases) of the COVID-19 using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), then to compare and validate the predicted models with the observed data. Methods: We used publicly available datasets from the World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University to create a training dataset, then we employed RNNs with gated recurring units (Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM units) to create two prediction models. Our proposed approach considers an ensemble-based system, which is realized by interconnecting several neural networks. To achieve the appropriate diversity, we froze some network layers that control the way how the model parameters are updated. In addition, we could provide country-specific predictions by transfer learning, and with extra feature injections from governmental constraints, better predictions in the longer term are achieved. We have calculated the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to thoroughly compare our model predictions with the observed data. Results: We reported the predicted curves for France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The result of our study underscores that the COVID-19 pandemic is a propagated source epidemic, therefore repeated peaks on the epidemic curve are to be anticipated. Besides, the errors between the predicted and validated data and trends seem to be low. Conclusion: Our proposed model has shown satisfactory accuracy in predicting the new cases of COVID-19 in certain contexts. The influence of this pandemic is significant worldwide and has already impacted most life domains. Decision-makers must be aware, that even if strict public health measures are executed and sustained, future peaks of infections are possible. The AI-based models are useful tools for forecasting epidemics as these models can be recalculated according to the newly observed data to get a more precise forecasting.},

   abstract = {A compartmental model is proposed to predict the Covid-19 virus spread. It considers: detected and undetected infected populations, social sequestration, release from sequestration, plus reinfection. This model, consisting of seven coupled equations, has eight coefficients which are evaluated by fitting data for eight US states that make up 43% of the US population. The evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact and undetected recovery rates remain below 5%; however, variations are larger in recovery rate, death rate, reinfection rate, sequestration adherence, and release rate from sequestration. Projections based on the current situation indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic. If lockdowns had been kept in place, the number of deaths would most likely have been significantly lower in states that opened up. Additionally, we predict that decreasing contact rate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown compliance (from the current ∼ 15% to ∼ 30%) will eradicate infections in Texas within a year. Extending our fits for all of the US states, we predict about 11 million total infections (including undetected), and 8 million cumulative confirmed cases by November 1 2020.},

We apply the suggested method to several benchmark functions to show its efficiency. The outcomes reveal that our algorithm performs superior to most existing algorithms in the literature in most benchmarks. Moreover, we apply our algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Since the prediction of the epidemic is a complicated task due to its stochastic nature, presenting efficient methods to solve the problem is vital. Since the healthcare system has a limited capacity, it is essential to predict the pandemic's future trend to avoid overload. Our results predict that the US will have almost 16 million cases by the end of November. The upcoming peak in the number of infected, ICU admitted cases would be mid-to-end November. In the end, we proposed several managerial insights that will help the policymakers have a clearer vision about the growth of COVID-19 and avoid equipment shortages in healthcare systems.},

   abstract = {<p>The swiftly growing and overwhelming epidemic in India has intensified the question: What will the trend and magnitude of impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) be in India in the near future? To answer the present question, the study requires ample historical data to make an accurate forecast of the blowout of expected confirmed cases. All at once, no prediction can be certain as the past seldom reiterates itself in the future likewise. Besides, forecasts are influenced by a number of factors like reliability of the data and psychological factors like perception and reaction of the people to the hazards arising from the epidemic. The present study presents a simple but powerful and objective, that is, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach, to analyse the temporal dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in India in the time window 30 January 2020 to 16 September 2020 and to predict the final size and trend of the epidemic over the period after 16 September 2020 with Indian epidemiological data at national and state levels. With the assumption that the data that have been used are reliable and that the future will continue to track the same outline as in the past, underlying forecasts based on ARIMA model suggest an unending increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India in the near future. The present article suggests varying epidemic’s inflection point and final size for underlying states and for the mainland, India. The final size at national level is expected to reach 25,669,294 in the next 230 days, with infection point that can be expected to be projected only on 23 April 2021. The study has enormous potential to plan and make decisions to control the further spread of epidemic in India and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the coming days corresponding to the respective COVID periods of the underlying regions.</p>},

   abstract = {A simple model for predicting Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is presented in this study. The prediction model is presented based on the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, which has been widely used to describe the epidemic time evolution of infectious diseases. The original version of the Kermack and McKendrick model is used in this study. This included the daily rates of infection spread by infected individuals when these individuals interact with a susceptible population, which is denoted by the parameter β, while the recovery rates to determine the number of recovered individuals is expressed by the parameter γ. The parameters estimation of the three-compartment SIR model is determined through using a mathematical sequential reduction process from the logistic growth model equation. As the parameters are the basic characteristics of epidemic time evolution, the model is always tested and applied to the latest actual data of confirmed COVID-19 cases. It seems that this simple model is still reliable enough to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively with a high degree of correlation between actual data and prediction results. Therefore, it is possible to apply this model to predict cases of COVID-19 in several countries. In addition, the parameter characteristics of the classic SIR model can provide information on how these parameters reflect the efforts by each country to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. This is clearly seen from the changes of the parameters shown by the classic SIR model.},

   abstract = {In November 2019, the coronavirus disease outbreak began, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In just over two months, the unprecedented rapid spread resulted in more than 10,000 confirmed cases worldwide. This study predicted the infectious spread of coronavirus disease in the contiguous United States using a convolutional autoencoder with long short-term memory and compared its predictive performance with that of the convolutional autoencoder without long short-term memory. The epidemic data were obtained from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from January 1st to April 6th, 2020. We used data from the first 366,607 confirmed cases in the United States. In this study, the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were gridded by latitude and longitude and the grids were categorized into six epidemic levels based on the number of confirmed cases. The input of the convolutional autoencoder with long short-term memory was the distribution of confirmed cases 14 days before, whereas the output was the distribution of confirmed cases 7 days after the date of testing. The mean square error in this model was 1.664, the peak signal-to-noise ratio was 55.699, and the structural similarity index was 0.99, which were better than those of the corresponding results of the convolutional autoencoder. These results showed that the convolutional autoencoder with long short-term memory effectively and reliably predicted the spread of infectious disease in the contiguous United States.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 has led to a pandemic, affecting almost all countries in a few months. In this work, we applied selected deep learning models including multilayer perceptron, random forest, and different versions of long short-term memory (LSTM), using three data sources to train the models, including COVID-19 occurrences, basic information like coded country names, and detailed information like population, and area of different countries. The main goal is to forecast the outbreak in nine countries (Iran, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Spain, China, and the USA). The performances of the models are measured using four metrics, including mean average percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (NRMSE), and R2. The best performance was found for a modified version of LSTM, called M-LSTM (winner model), to forecast the future trajectory of the pandemic in the mentioned countries. For this purpose, we collected the data from January 22 till July 30, 2020, for training, and from 1 August 2020 to 31 August 2020, for the testing phase. Through experimental results, the winner model achieved reasonably accurate predictions (MAPE, RMSE, NRMSE, and R2 are 0.509, 458.12, 0.001624, and 0.99997, respectively). Furthermore, we stopped the training of the model on some dates related to main country actions to investigate the effect of country actions on predictions by the model.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening billions of people's life all over the world. As of March 6, 2021, covid-19 has confirmed in 115,653,459 people worldwide. It has also a devastating effect on businesses and social activities. Since there is still no definite cure for this disease, extensive testing is the most critical issue to determine the trend of illness, appropriate medical treatment, and make social distancing policies. Besides, testing more people in a shorter time helps to contain the contagion. The PCR-based methods are the most popular tests which take about an hour to make the output result. Obviously, it makes the number of tests highly limited and consequently, hurts the efficiency of pandemic control. In this paper, we propose a new approach to identify affected individuals with a considerably reduced No. of tests. Intuitively, saving time and resources is the main advantage of our approach. We use contextual information to make a graph-based model to be used in model-based compressive sensing (CS). Our proposed model makes the testing with fewer tests required compared to traditional testing methods and even group testing. We embed contextual information such as age, underlying disease, symptoms (i.e. cough, fever, fatigue, loss of consciousness), and social contacts into a graph-based model. This model is used in model-based CS to minimize the required test. We take advantage of Discrete Graph Signal Processing on Graph (DSPG) to generate the model. Our contextual model makes CS more efficient in both the number of samples and the recovery quality. Moreover, it can be applied in the case that group testing is not applicable due to its severe dependency on sparsity. Experimental results show that the overall testing speed (individuals per test ratio) increases more than 15 times compared to the individual testing with the error of less than 5% which is dramatically lower than that of traditional compressive sensing.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 has produced a global pandemic affecting all over of the world. Prediction of the rate of COVID-19 spread and modeling of its course have critical impact on both health system and policy makers. Indeed, policy making depends on judgments formed by the prediction models to propose new strategies and to measure the efficiency of the imposed policies. Based on the nonlinear and complex nature of this disorder and difficulties in estimation of virus transmission features using traditional epidemic models, artificial intelligence methods have been applied for prediction of its spread. Based on the importance of machine and deep learning approaches in the estimation of COVID-19 spreading trend, in the present study, we review studies which used these strategies to predict the number of new cases of COVID-19. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, long short-term memory, recurrent neural network and multilayer perceptron are among the mostly used strategies in this regard. We compared the performance of several machine learning methods in prediction of COVID-19 spread. Root means squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R
2
coefficient of determination (R
2
), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) parameters were selected as performance measures for comparison of the accuracy of models. R
2
values have ranged from 0.64 to 1 for artificial neural network (ANN) and Bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM), respectively. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) have also have R
2
values near 1. ARIMA and LSTM had the highest MAPE values. Collectively, these models are capable of identification of learning parameters that affect dissimilarities in COVID-19 spread across various regions or populations, combining numerous intervention methods and implementing what-if scenarios by integrating data from diseases having analogous trends with COVID-19. Therefore, application of these methods would help in precise policy making to design the most appropriate interventions and avoid non-efficient restrictions.},

@article{Gaudou2020,
   abstract = {Since its emergence in China, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly around the world. Faced with this unknown disease, public health authorities were forced to experiment, in a short period of time, with various combinations of interventions at different scales. However, as the pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for tools and methodologies to quickly analyze the effectiveness of responses against COVID-19 in different communities and contexts. In this perspective, computer modeling appears to be an invaluable lever as it allows for the in silico exploration of a range of intervention strategies prior to the potential field implementation phase. More specifically, we argue that, in order to take into account important dimensions of policy actions, such as the heterogeneity of the individual response or the spatial aspect of containment strategies, the branch of computer modeling known as agent-based modeling is of immense interest. We present in this paper an agent-based modeling framework called COVID-19 Modeling Kit (COMOKIT), designed to be generic, scalable and thus portable in a variety of social and geographical contexts. COMOKIT combines models of person-to-person and environmental transmission, a model of individual epidemiological status evolution, an agenda-based 1-h time step model of human mobility, and an intervention model. It is designed to be modular and flexible enough to allow modelers and users to represent different strategies and study their impacts in multiple social, epidemiological or economic scenarios. Several large-scale experiments are analyzed in this paper and allow us to show the potentialities of COMOKIT in terms of analysis and comparison of the impacts of public health policies in a realistic case study.},
