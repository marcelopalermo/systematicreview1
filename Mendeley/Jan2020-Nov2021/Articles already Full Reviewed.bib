   abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to further improve the current time-series prediction (forecasting) algorithms based on hybrids between machine learning and nature-inspired algorithms. After the recent COVID-19 outbreak, almost all countries were forced to impose strict measures and regulations in order to control the virus spread. Predicting the number of new cases is crucial when evaluating which measures should be implemented. The improved forecasting approach was then used to predict the number of the COVID-19 cases. The proposed prediction model represents a hybridized approach between machine learning, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and enhanced beetle antennae search swarm intelligence metaheuristics. The enhanced beetle antennae search is utilized to determine the parameters of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and to improve the overall performance of the prediction model. First, an enhanced beetle antennae search algorithm has been implemented that overcomes deficiencies of its original version. The enhanced algorithm was tested and validated against a wider set of benchmark functions and proved that it substantially outperforms original implementation. Afterwards, the proposed hybrid method for COVID-19 cases prediction was then evaluated using the World Health Organization's official data on the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The proposed method has been compared against several existing state-of-the-art approaches that were tested on the same datasets. The proposed CESBAS-ANFIS achieved R2 score of 0.9763, which is relatively high when compared to the R2 value of 0.9645, achieved by FPASSA-ANFIS. To further evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, it has also been validated against two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in China and the USA. Simulation results and the comparative analysis show that the proposed hybrid method managed to outscore other sophisticated approaches that were tested on the same datasets and proved to be a useful tool for time-series prediction.},

   abstract = {We apply a generalized logistic growth model, with time-dependent parameters, to describe the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease for several countries that exhibit multiple waves of infections. In the case of two waves only, the model parameters vary as a function of time according to a logistic function, whose two extreme values, i.e., for early and late times, characterize the first and second waves, respectively. For the multiple-wave model, the time-dependency of the parameters is likewise described by a multi-step logistic function with N intermediate plateaus, representing the N waves of the epidemic. We show that the theoretical curves are in excellent agreement with the empirical data for all countries considered here, namely: Brazil, Canada, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden, and the USA. The model also allows for predictions about the time of occurrence and severity of the subsequent waves. It is shown furthermore that the subsequent waves of COVID-19 can be generically classified into two main types, namely, standard and anomalous waves, according as to whether a given wave starts well after or well before the preceding one has subsided, respectively.},

   abstract = {Background: Time-series forecasting has a critical role during pandemics as it provides essential information that can lead to abstaining from the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is spreading rapidly all over the world. The countries with dense populations, in particular, such as India, await imminent risk in tackling the epidemic. Different forecasting models are being used to predict future cases of COVID-19. The predicament for most of them is that they are not able to capture both the linear and nonlinear features of the data solely. Methods: We propose an ensemble model integrating an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR). ARIMA models are used to extract the linear correlations and the NAR neural network for modeling the residuals of ARIMA containing nonlinear components of the data. Comparison: Single ARIMA model, ARIMA-NAR model and few other existing models which have been applied on the COVID-19 data in different countries are compared based on performance evaluation parameters. Result: The hybrid combination displayed significant reduction in RMSE (16.23%), MAE (37.89%) and MAPE (39.53%) values when compared with single ARIMA model for daily observed cases. Similar results with reduced error percentages were found for daily reported deaths and cases of recovery as well. RMSE value of our hybrid model was lesser in comparison to other models used for forecasting COVID-19 in different countries. Conclusion: Results suggested the effectiveness of the new hybrid model over a single ARIMA model in capturing the linear as well as nonlinear patterns of the COVID-19 data.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Mathematical modeling of vector-borne diseases and forecasting of epidemics outbreak are global challenges and big point of concern worldwide. The outbreaks depend on different social and demographic factors based on human mobility structured with the help of mathematical models for vector-borne disease transmission. In Dec 2019, an infectious disease is known as "coronavirus" (officially declared as COVID-19 by WHO) emerged in Wuhan (Capital city of Hubei, China) and spread quickly to all over the china with over 50,000 cases including more than 1000 death within a short period of one month. Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. OBJECTIVES The main objective of this proposed hybrid computing technique are as follows: The innovative design of the NAR-RBFs neural network paradigm is designed to construct the SITR epidemic differential equation (DE) model to ascertain the different features of the spread of COVID-19. The new set of transformations is introduced for nonlinear input to achieve with a higher level of accuracy, stability, and convergence analysis. METHODS Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. In this research bimodal spread of COVID-19 is investigated with hybrid model based on nonlinear autoregressive with radial base function (NAR-RBFs) neural network for SITR model. Chaotic and stochastic data of the pandemic. A new class of transformation is presented for the system of ordinary differential equation (ODE) for fast convergence and improvement of desired accuracy level. The proposed transformations convert local optimum values to global values before implementation of bimodal paradigm. RESULTS This suggested NAR-RBFs model is investigated for the bi-module nature of SITR model with additional feature of fragility in modeling of stochastic variation ability for different cases and scenarios with constraints variation. Best agreement of the proposed bimodal paradigm with outstanding numerical solver is confirmed based on statistical results calculated from MSE, RMSE and MAPE with accuracy level based on mean square error up to 1E-25, which further validates the stability and consistence of bimodal proposed model. CONCLUSIONS This computational technique is shown extraordinary results in terms of accuracy and convergence. The outcomes of this study will be useful in forecasting the progression of COVID-19, the influence of several deciding parameters overspread of COVID-19 and can help for planning, monitoring as well as preventing the spread of COVID-19.},

   abstract = {The significant health and economic effects of COVID-19 emphasize the requirement for reliable forecasting models to avoid the sudden collapse of healthcare facilities with overloaded hospitals. Several forecasting models have been developed based on the data acquired within the early stages of the virus spread. However, with the recent emergence of new virus variants, it is unclear how the new strains could influence the efficiency of forecasting using models adopted using earlier data. In this study, we analyzed daily positive cases (DPC) data using a machine learning model to understand the effect of new viral variants on morbidity rates. A deep learning model that considers several environmental and mobility factors was used to forecast DPC in six districts of Japan. From machine learning predictions with training data since the early days of COVID-19, high-quality estimation has been achieved for data obtained earlier than March 2021. However, a significant upsurge was observed in some districts after the discovery of the new COVID-19 variant B.1.1.7 (Alpha). An average increase of 20–40% in DPC was observed after the emergence of the Alpha variant and an increase of up to 20% has been recognized in the effective reproduction number. Approximately four weeks was needed for the machine learning model to adjust the forecasting error caused by the new variants. The comparison between machine-learning predictions and reported values demonstrated that the emergence of new virus variants should be considered within COVID-19 forecasting models. This study presents an easy yet efficient way to quantify the change caused by new viral variants with potential usefulness for global data analysis.},

A persistent increase in the number of positive cases has boost the stress among governments across the globe. There is a need of approach which gives more accurate predictions of outbreak. This paper presents a novel approach called diffusion prediction model for prediction of number of coronavirus cases in four countries: India, France, China and Nepal. Diffusion prediction model works on the diffusion process of the human contact. Model considers two forms of spread: when the spread takes time after infecting one person and when the spread is immediate after infecting one person. It makes the proposed model different over other state-of-the art models. It is giving more accurate results than other state-of-the art models. The proposed diffusion prediction model forecasts the number of new cases expected to occur in next 4 weeks. The model has predicted the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and active cases. The model can facilitate government to be well prepared for any abrupt rise in this pandemic. The performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and error rate and compared with the prediction results of support vector machine, logistic regression model and convolution neural network. The results prove the efficiency of the proposed model.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a major pandemic threat that has spread to more than 212 countries with more than 432,902 recorded deaths and 7,898,442 confirmed cases worldwide so far (on June 14, 2020). It is crucial to investigate the spatial drivers to prevent and control the epidemic of COVID-19. Methods: This is the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 in Iran; and it carries out spatial modeling, risk mapping, change detection, and outbreak trend analysis of the disease spread. Four main steps were taken: comparison of Iranian coronavirus data with the global trends, prediction of mortality trends using regression modeling, spatial modeling, risk mapping, and change detection using the random forest (RF) machine learning technique (MLT), and validation of the modeled risk map. Results: The results show that from February 19 to June 14, 2020, the average growth rates (GR) of COVID-19 deaths and the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran were 1.08 and 1.10, respectively. Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) data, Iran's fatality rate (deaths/0.1 M pop) is 10.53. Other countries' fatality rates were, for comparison, Belgium – 83.32, UK – 61.39, Spain – 58.04, Italy – 56.73, Sweden – 48.28, France – 45.04, USA – 35.52, Canada – 21.49, Brazil – 20.10, Peru – 19.70, Chile – 16.20, Mexico– 12.80, and Germany – 10.58. The fatality rate for China is 0.32 (deaths/0.1 M pop). Over time, the heatmap of the infected areas identified two critical time intervals for the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. The provinces were classified in terms of disease and death rates into a large primary group and three provinces that had critical outbreaks were separate from the others. The heatmap of countries of the world shows that China and Italy were distinguished from other countries in terms of nine viral infection-related parameters. The regression models for death cases showed an increasing trend but with some evidence of turning. A polynomial relationship was identified between the coronavirus infection rate and the province population density. Also, a third-degree polynomial regression model for deaths showed an increasing trend recently, indicating that subsequent measures taken to cope with the outbreak have been insufficient and ineffective. The general trend of deaths in Iran is similar to the world's, but Iran's shows lower volatility. Change detection of COVID-19 risk maps with a random forest model for the period from March 11 to March 18 showed an increasing trend of COVID-19 in Iran's provinces. It is worth noting that using the LASSO MLT to evaluate variables' importance, indicated that the most important variables were the distance from bus stations, bakeries, hospitals, mosques, ATMs (automated teller machines), banks, and the minimum temperature of the coldest month. Conclusions: We believe that this study's risk maps are the primary, fundamental step to take for managing and controlling COVID-19 in Iran and its provinces.},

Considering the five environmental vectors of carrier vulnerability, environmental instability of pregnancy and disaster, intensity of disaster-causing factors, disaster prevention and mitigation capacity and emergency prevention and control capacity and its 38 indicators, the correlation coefficient matrix and principal component expressions of each vector are established by principal component analysis, respectively, and the index model of each vector is established on the basis. Then, considering the index models of these five vectors, we established the disaster loss composite index model, which was used to conduct environmental risk assessment and disaster loss composite index analysis of the transmission of COVID-19 in Hubei Province during the period of January 21, 2020 to March 18, 2020. The empirical study showed that: (1) the risk index peaked from January 21 to January 23; (2) the risk index was at a low but volatile level from January 24 to March 14; (3) the risk index rose again slightly from March 15 and rose to another peak on March 16. These fluctuating, smooth and fluctuating processes of the comprehensive index of disaster losses of COVID-19 in Hubei Province are basically stable and consistent with the actual situation of the virus outbreak in the early stage, isolation and prevention and control in the middle stage, and resumption of work and production in the late stage. The study in this paper provides a scientific decision-making reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19 as well as emergency prevention and control measures.},

   abstract = {To inform data-driven decisions in fighting the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, this research develops a spatiotemporal analysis framework under the combination of an ensemble model (random forest regression) and a multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II). It has been verified for four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, and Nepal. Accordingly, we can gain some valuable experience to better understand the disease evolution, forecast the prevalence of the disease, which can provide sustainable evidence to guide further intervention and management. Random forest with a proper rolling time-window can learn the combined effects of environmental and social factors to accurately predict the daily growth of confirmed cases and daily death rate on a national scale, which is followed by NSGA-II to find a range of Pareto optimal solutions for ensuring the minimization of the infection rate and mortality at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate that the predictive model can alert the local government in advance, allowing the accused time to put forward relevant measures. The temperature in the category of environment and the stringency index belonging to the social factor are identified as the top 2 important features to exert a greater impact on the virus transmission. Moreover, optimal solutions provide references to design the best control strategies towards pandemic containment and prevention that can accommodate the country-specific circumstance, which are possible to decrease the two objectives by more than 95%. In particular, appropriate adjustment of social-related features needs to take priority over others, since it can bring about at least 1.47% average improvement of two objectives compared to environmental factors.},

   abstract = {Pandemic defines the global outbreak of a disease having a high transmission rate. The impact of a pandemic situation can be lessened by restricting the movement of the mass. However, one of its concomitant circumstances is an economic crisis. In this article, we demonstrate what actions an agent (trained using reinforcement learning) may take in different possible scenarios of a pandemic depending on the spread of disease and economic factors. To train the agent, we design a virtual pandemic scenario closely related to the present COVID-19 crisis. Then, we apply reinforcement learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, that deals with how an individual (human/machine) should interact on an environment (real/virtual) to achieve the cherished goal. Finally, we demonstrate what optimal actions the agent perform to reduce the spread of disease while considering the economic factors. In our experiment, we let the agent find an optimal solution without providing any prior knowledge. After training, we observed that the agent places a long length lockdown to reduce the first surge of a disease. Furthermore, the agent places a combination of cyclic lockdowns and short length lockdowns to halt the resurgence of the disease. Analyzing the agent's performed actions, we discover that the agent decides movement restrictions not only based on the number of the infectious population but also considering the reproduction rate of the disease. The estimation and policy of the agent may improve the human-strategy of placing lockdown so that an economic crisis may be avoided while mitigating an infectious disease.},

Forecasting has been one of the most powerful statistical methods employed the world over in various disciplines for detecting and analyzing trends and predicting future outcomes based on which timely and mitigating actions can be undertaken. To that end, several statistical methods and machine learning techniques have been harnessed depending upon the analysis desired and the availability of data.

The LSTM model exhibits the best performance in forecasting the cumulative infections for one week and one month ahead. Finally, the LSTM model with the optimal parameter values is applied to forecast the spread of this epidemic for one month ahead using the data from 14 February 2020 to 30 June 2021. The total size of infections, recoveries, and deaths is estimated to be 285,939, 234,747, and 17,251 cases on 31 July 2021. This study could assist the decision-makers in developing and monitoring policies to confront this disease.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is a worldwide transmitted pandemic that has brought a threatening challenge to Indian society and the economy. The disease has become a public health disaster, which has no effective medication. However, proper management and planning, which includes understanding the transmitting pattern, number of containment zones, vulnerable factors, and level of risk, may break the chain of transmission and reduce the number of cases. Hence, this study has attempted to model the COVID-19 vulnerability using an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, namely fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for West Bengal, India, through geographic information system (GIS). A total of 15 parameters were utilised to model the COVID-19 vulnerability, which was further categorised into three criteria: social vulnerability, epidemiological vulnerability, and physical vulnerability. The final vulnerability mapping has been done using these three criteria through the GIS platform. This study reveals that COVID-19 infection highly threatens about 20% of the total area of West Bengal, 23.42% moderately vulnerable, and 57.03% of the area comes under low vulnerability. The highly vulnerable region includes the Kolkata, South 24 Paraganas, and North 24 Paraganas, which are considered highly populated districts of West Bengal. Therefore government agencies should be more focused and plan accordingly to safeguard the community, especially the region with very high COVID-19 vulnerability, from further spreading the infection.},

Until now, although the US has the most confirmed cases in the world and are still experiencing an increasing pandemic, several states insisted to re-open business activities and colleges while announced strict control measures. To provide a quantitative reference for official strategies, predicting the near future trend based on finer spatial resolution data and presumed scenarios are urgently needed. In this study, the first attempted COVID-19 case predicting model based on county-level demographic, environmental, and mobility data was constructed with multiple machine learning techniques and a hybrid framework. Different scenarios were also applied to selected metropolitan counties including New York City, Cook County in Illinois, Los Angeles County in California, and Miami-Dade County in Florida to assess the impact from lockdown, Phase I, and Phase III re-opening. Our results showed that, for selected counties, the mobility decreased substantially after the lockdown but kept increasing with an apparent weekly pattern, and the weekly pattern of mobility and infections implied high infections during the weekend. Meanwhile, our model was successfully built up, and the scenario assessment results indicated that, compared with Phase I re-opening, a 1-week and a 2-week lockdown could reduce 4%-29% and 15%-55% infections, respectively, in the future week, while 2-week Phase III re-opening could increase 16%-80% infections. We concluded that the mandatory orders in metropolitan counties such lockdown should last longer than one week, the effect could be observed. The impact of lockdown or re-opening was also county-dependent and varied with the local pandemic. In future works, we expect to involve a longer period of data, consider more county-dependent factors, and employ more sophisticated techniques to decrease the modeling uncertainty and apply it to counties nationally and other countries.},

Most models fail to provide flexible and rapid simulation of various epidemic scenarios for policy assessment. This paper establishes a multi-scale agent-based model to investigate the infectious disease propagation between cities and within a city using the knowledge from person-to-person transmission. In the model, the contact and infection of individuals at the micro scale where an agent represents a person provide insights for the interactions of agents at the meso scale where an agent refers to hundreds of individuals. Four cities with frequent population movements in China are taken as an example and actual data on traffic patterns and demographic parameters are adopted. The scenarios for dynamic propagation of infectious disease with no external measures are compared versus the scenarios with vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions. The model predicts that the peak of infections will decline by 67.37% with 80% vaccination rate, compared to a drop of 89.56% when isolation and quarantine measures are also in place. The results highlight the importance of controlling the source of infection by isolation and quarantine throughout the epidemic. We also study the effect when cities implement inconsistent public health interventions, which is common in practical situations. Based on our results, the model can be applied to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases according to the various needs of government agencies.},

   abstract = {Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic is considered a major threat to global public health. The aim of our study was to use the official epidemiological data to forecast the epidemic curves (daily new cases) of the COVID-19 using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), then to compare and validate the predicted models with the observed data. Methods: We used publicly available datasets from the World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University to create a training dataset, then we employed RNNs with gated recurring units (Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM units) to create two prediction models. Our proposed approach considers an ensemble-based system, which is realized by interconnecting several neural networks. To achieve the appropriate diversity, we froze some network layers that control the way how the model parameters are updated. In addition, we could provide country-specific predictions by transfer learning, and with extra feature injections from governmental constraints, better predictions in the longer term are achieved. We have calculated the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to thoroughly compare our model predictions with the observed data. Results: We reported the predicted curves for France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The result of our study underscores that the COVID-19 pandemic is a propagated source epidemic, therefore repeated peaks on the epidemic curve are to be anticipated. Besides, the errors between the predicted and validated data and trends seem to be low. Conclusion: Our proposed model has shown satisfactory accuracy in predicting the new cases of COVID-19 in certain contexts. The influence of this pandemic is significant worldwide and has already impacted most life domains. Decision-makers must be aware, that even if strict public health measures are executed and sustained, future peaks of infections are possible. The AI-based models are useful tools for forecasting epidemics as these models can be recalculated according to the newly observed data to get a more precise forecasting.},

The training data are used to train the MLP network, and the trained MLP network is used to predict the test data and the next 40 days. Then the residual errors of actual and predicted values are calculated. In the next step, the MC model is used to classify the errors and predict the values of the indicators according to the probabilities related to the error states and improve the performance of the MLP model in forecasting. Finally, the prediction accuracy of MLP and MLP-MC models are compared using three evaluation metrics: MAD, MSE and RMSE. This comparison showed that the MLP-MC model has slightly higher prediction accuracy than the MLP model.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to propose a full-scale individual-based model of the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy, to test various scenarios pertaining to the pandemic and achieve novel performance metrics. METHODS: The model was designed to simulate all 10 million inhabitants of Lombardy person by person via a simple agent-based approach using a commercial computer. In order to obtain performance data, a collision detection model was developed to enable cluster nodes in small cells that can be processed fully in parallel. Within this collision detection model, an epidemic model based mostly on experimental findings about COVID-19 was developed. RESULTS: The model was used to explain the behavior of the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy. Different parameters were used to simulate various scenarios relating to social distancing and lockdown. According to the model, these simple actions were enough to control the virus. The model also explained the decline in cases in the spring and simulated a hypothetical vaccination scenario, confirming, for example, the herd immunity threshold computed in previous works. CONCLUSIONS: The model made it possible to test the impact of people's daily actions (eg, maintaining social distance) on the epidemic and to investigate interactions among agents within a social network. It also provided insight on the impact of a hypothetical vaccine.},

Yet, it is simple enough to allow scalable and efficient computation of the temporal evolution of the epidemic, and exploration of what–if scenarios. Compared to traditional compartmental models, our approach allows a more faithful description of virus specific features, such as distributions for the time spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g., mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding light onto several effects related to mobility restrictions introduced by the government, and to the effectiveness of contact tracing and mass testing performed by the national health service.},

   abstract = {On 21 February 2020, a violent COVID-19 outbreak, which was initially concentrated in Lombardy before infecting some surrounding regions exploded in Italy. Shortly after, on 9 March, the Italian Government imposed severe restrictions on its citizens, including a ban on traveling to other parts of the country. No travel, no virus spread. Many regions, such as those in southern Italy, were spared. Then, in June 2020, under pressure for the economy to reopen, many lockdown measures were relaxed, including the ban on interregional travel. As a result, the virus traveled for hundreds of kilometers, from north to south, with the effect that areas without infections, receiving visitors from infected areas, became infected. This resulted in a sharp increase in the number of infected people; i.e., the daily count of new positive cases, when comparing measurements from the beginning of July to those from at the middle of September, rose significantly in almost all the Italian regions. Upon confirmation of the effect of Italian domestic tourism on the virus spread, three computational models of increasing complexity (linear, negative binomial regression, and cognitive) have been compared in this study, with the aim of identifying the one that better correlates the relationship between Italian tourist flows during the summer of 2020 and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases across the country. Results show that the cognitive model has more potential than the others, yet has relevant limitations. The models should be considered as a relevant starting point for the study of this phenomenon, even if there is still room to further develop them up to a point where they become able to capture all the various and complex spread patterns of this disease.},

Assessing and mapping the COVID-19 risk zones and modeling the response of COVID-19 using different scenarios are very vital to help decision-makers to estimate the immediate number of resources needed and plan for future interventions of COVID-19 in the area of interest. This study is aimed to identify and map COVID-19 risk zones and to model future COVID-19 response of Namibia using geospatial technologies. Population density, current COVID-19 infections, and spatial interaction index were used as proxy data to identify the different COVID-19 risk zones of Namibia. COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) V1.1.5 tool was used to model future COVID-19 responses with mobility restrictions. Weights were assigned for each thematic layer and thematic layer classes using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) tool. Suitably ArcGIS overlay analysis was conducted to produce risk zones. Current COVID-19 infection and spatial mobility index were found to be the dominant and sensitive factors for risk zoning in Namibia. Six different COVID-19 risk zones were identified in the study area, namely highest, higher, high, low, lower, and lowest. Modeling result revealed that mobility reduction by 30% within the country had a notable effect on controlling COVID-19 spread: a flattening of the peak number of cases and delay to the peak number. The research output could help policy-makers to estimate the immediate number of resources needed and plan for future interventions of COVID-19 in Namibia, especially to assess the potential positive effects of mobility restriction.},

The timely decisions taken by the government helped in decelerating the spread of COVID-19 to a large extent. Despite these decisions, the pandemic continues to spread. Future predictions about the spread can be helpful for future policy-making, i.e., to plan and control the COVID-19 spread. Further, it is observed throughout the world that asymptomatic corona cases play a major role in the spread of the disease. This motivated us to include such cases for accurate trend prediction. India was chosen for the study as the population and population density is very high for India, resulting in the spread of the disease at high speed. In this paper, the modified SEIRD (susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered–deceased) model is proposed for predicting the trend and peak of COVID-19 in India and its four worst-affected states. The modified SEIRD model is based on the SEIRD model, which also uses an asymptomatic exposed population that is asymptomatic but infectious for the predictions. Further, a deep learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) model is also used for trend prediction in this paper. Predictions of LSTM are compared with the predictions obtained from the proposed modified SEIRD model for the next 30 days. The epidemiological data up to 6th September 2020 have been used for carrying out predictions in this paper. Different lockdowns imposed by the Indian government have also been used in modeling and analyzing the proposed modified SEIRD model.},

We propose a functional form of birth rate that depends on the number of individuals in the population and on the elapsed time, allowing us to model a contagion effect. Thus, we model the early stages of an epidemic. The number of individuals then becomes the infectious cases and the birth rate becomes the incidence rate. We obtain this way a process that depends on two competitive phenomena, infection and immunization. Variations in those rates allow us to monitor how effective the actions taken by government and health organizations are. From our model, three useful indicators for the epidemic evolution over time are obtained: the immunization rate, the infection/immunization ratio and the mean time between infections (MTBI). The proposed model allows either positive or negative concavities for the mean value curve, provided the infection/immunization ratio is either greater or less than one. We apply this model to the present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still in its early growth stage in Latin American countries. As it is shown, the model accomplishes a good fit for the real number of both positive cases and deaths. We analyze the evolution of the three indicators for several countries and perform a comparative study between them. Important conclusions are obtained from this analysis.},

Joining the Brazilian academia efforts in the fight against Covid-19, in this paper we describe a unified framework for monitoring and forecasting the Covid-19 progress in the state of São Paulo.

Moreover, a novel forecasting data-driven method has also been proposed, by combining the so-called Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased model with machine learning strategies to better fit the mathematical model's coefficients for predicting Infections, Recoveries, Deaths, and Viral Reproduction Numbers. We show that the obtained predictor is capable of dealing with badly conditioned data samples while still delivering accurate 10-day predictions. Our integrated computational system can be used for guiding government actions mainly in two basic aspects: real-time data assessment and dynamic predictions of Covid-19 curves for different regions of the state.

Knowing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases each day is critical for mathematical modeling to be able to identify the behavioral effects of the pandemic. It forecasts the situation for the upcoming 700 days. The proposed system predicts whether COVID-19 will spread in the population or die out in the long run. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak and its possible end for three types of scenarios: “no actions,” “lockdown,” and “new medicines.” The effect of interventions like lockdown and new medicines is compared with the “no actions” scenario. The lockdown case delays the peak point by decreasing the infection and affects the area equality rule of the infected curves. On the other side, new medicines have a significant impact on infected curve by decreasing the number of infected people about time. Available forecast data on COVID-19 using simulations predict that the highest level of cases might occur between 15 and 30 November 2020. Simulation data suggest that the virus might be fully under control only after June 2021. The reproductive rate shows that measures such as government lockdowns and isolation of individuals are not enough to stop the pandemic. This study recommends that authorities should, as soon as possible, apply a strict long-term containment strategy to reduce the epidemic size successfully.</p>},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND The high prevalence of COVID-19 has made it a new pandemic. Predicting both its prevalence and incidence throughout the world is crucial to help health professionals make key decisions. In this study, we aim to predict the incidence of COVID-19 within a two-week period to better manage the disease. METHODS The COVID-19 datasets provided by Johns Hopkins University, contain information on COVID-19 cases in different geographic regions since January 22, 2020 and are updated daily. Data from 252 such regions were analyzed as of March 29, 2020, with 17,136 records and 4 variables, namely latitude, longitude, date, and records. In order to design the incidence pattern for each geographic region, the information was utilized on the region and its neighboring areas gathered 2 weeks prior to the designing. Then, a model was developed to predict the incidence rate for the coming 2 weeks via a Least-Square Boosting Classification algorithm. RESULTS The model was presented for three groups based on the incidence rate: less than 200, between 200 and 1000, and above 1000. The mean absolute error of model evaluation were 4.71, 8.54, and 6.13%, respectively. Also, comparing the forecast results with the actual values in the period in question showed that the proposed model predicted the number of globally confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a very high accuracy of 98.45%. CONCLUSION Using data from different geographical regions within a country and discovering the pattern of prevalence in a region and its neighboring areas, our boosting-based model was able to accurately predict the incidence of COVID-19 within a two-week period.},
