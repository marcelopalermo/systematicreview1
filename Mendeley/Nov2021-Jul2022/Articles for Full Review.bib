   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the economy and businesses and impacted all facets of people’s lives. It is critical to forecast the number of infected cases to make accurate decisions on the necessary measures to control the outbreak. While deep learning models have proved to be effective in this context, time series augmentation can improve their performance. In this paper, we use time series augmentation techniques to create new time series that take into account the characteristics of the original series, which we then use to generate enough samples to fit deep learning models properly. The proposed method is applied in the context of COVID-19 time series forecasting using three deep learning techniques, (1) the long short-term memory, (2) gated recurrent units, and (3) convolutional neural network. In terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error measures, the proposed method significantly improves the performance of long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks. Also, the improvement is average for the gated recurrent units. Finally, we present a summary of the top augmentation model as well as a visual representation of the actual and forecasted data for each country.},

   abstract = {Individuals' flow's fluidifcation in the same way as the thinning of the population's concentration remains among major concerns within the context of the pandemic crisis situations. The recent COVID-19 pandemic crisis is a typical example of the aforementioned where on despite of the containment phases that radically isolate the population but are not applicable persistently, people have to adapt their behavior to new daily-life situations tempering Individuals' stream, avoiding tides, and watering down population's concentration. Crowd evacuation is one of the well-known research domains that can play a pertinent role to face the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, considering the population's concentration thinning within the slant of the “crowd evacuation” paradigm allows managing the flow of the population, and consequently, decreasing the probable number of infected cases. In other words, crowd evacuation modeling and simulation with the aim of better-exploiting individuals' flow allow the study and analysis of different possible outcomes for designing population's concentration thinning strategies. In this article, a new decision-making approach is proposed in order to cope with the aforesaid challenges, which relies on an independent Deep Q Network with an improved SIR model (IDQN-I-SIR). The machine-learning component (i.e., IDQN) is in charge of the agent's movements control and I-SIR (improved “susceptible-infected-recovered” individuals) model is responsible to control the virus spread. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IDQN-I-SIR through a case-study of individuals' flow's management with infected cases' avoidance in an emergency department (often overcrowded in context of a pandemic crisis).},

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease that outbreak in 2019 has caused various health issues. According to the WHO, the first positive case was detected in Bangladesh on 7th March 2020, but while writing this paper in June 2021, the total confirmed, recovered, and death cases were 826922, 766266 and 13118, respectively. Due to the emergence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh, the country is facing a major public health crisis. Unfortunately, the country does not have a comprehensive health policy to address this issue. This makes it hard to predict how the pandemic will affect the population. Machine learning techniques can help us detect the disease's spread. To predict the trend, parameters, risks, and to take preventive measure in Bangladesh; this work utilized the Recurrent Neural Networks based Deep Learning methodologies like LongShort-Term Memory. Here, we aim to predict the epidemic's progression for a period of more than a year under various scenarios in Bangladesh. We extracted the data for daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases from March 2020 to August 2021. The obtained Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of confirmed, recovered, and death cases indicates that our result is more accurate than other contemporary techniques. This study indicates that the LSTM model could be used effectively in predicting contagious diseases. The obtained results could help in explaining the seriousness of the situation, also mayhelp the authorities to take precautionary steps to control the situation.},

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) primarily spreads through imbalanced social distancing practices. Automatic analysis is possible through deep learning-based methods to understand and control COVID-19. Healthcare analysis and prediction are best made in the situation of a pandemic such as COVID-19. This analysis can be used to classify the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups and social distancing measures with good estimation by preventing immense dissemination. Postpreventive measures require parallel reinforcement to analyse current, upcoming, and uncertain situations of COVID-19 prevalence, which are effectively handled by implementing multicriteria decision-making methods. Herein, we estimate and measure the social distance by deep learning technique usage (You Only Look Once, Version 3 is a real-time object detection algorithm) in the proposed model for the analytic network process. The multicriteria decision making increases the evaluation of the risk factors. The modification of the pandemic model increases the application of social distancing and preventive measures. This model will alert us when the number of people exceeds in some area from the experimented barrier. RISTECB simulation is used in the preventive measures of the social distance among the sample population to see the initiators, infectors, suspicious, expirer, survivor, and transmitters. Postpreventive criteria used those results to set the barriers that are the critical points for prevention in uncertain situations. Therefore, this paper aimed to develop a framework, including social distancing and distance estimation, by using deep learning-based techniques through multicriteria decision-making methods such as the analytical network process. For simulation for statistical information of inclusive information of preventive measures and postpreventive measures, an automatic resonant transfer learning-based practice is used. General proportional analyses illustrate that the projected model helps in postpandemic COVID-19 preventive measures by amalgamating multiple techniques.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many low- and middle-income countries, causing widespread food insecurity and a sharp decline in living standards1. In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have distributed social assistance to more than 1.5 billion people2. Targeting is a central challenge in administering these programmes: it remains a difficult task to rapidly identify those with the greatest need given available data3,4. Here we show that data from mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of humanitarian assistance. Our approach uses traditional survey data to train machine-learning algorithms to recognize patterns of poverty in mobile phone data; the trained algorithms can then prioritize aid to the poorest mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying a flagship emergency cash transfer program in Togo, which used these algorithms to disburse millions of US dollars worth of COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes—including exclusion errors, total social welfare and measures of fairness—under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo, the machine-learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4–21%. Relative to methods requiring a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise; no such registry exists in Togo), the machine-learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9–35%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to complement traditional methods for targeting humanitarian assistance, particularly in crisis settings in which traditional data are missing or out of date.},

   abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia globally, with a growing morbidity burden that may exceed diagnosis and management capabilities. The situation worsens when AD patient fatalities are exposed to COVID-19. Because of differences in clinical features and patient condition, a patient's recovery from COVID-19 with or without AD varies greatly. Thus, this situation stimulates a spectrum of imbalanced data. The inclusion of different features in the class imbalance offers substantial problems for developing of a classification framework. This study proposes a framework to handle class imbalance and select the most suitable and representative datasets for the hybrid model. Under this framework, various state-of-the-art resample techniques were utilized to balance the datasets, and three sets of data were finally selected. We developed a novel hybrid deep learning model AD-CovNet using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms that delineate three unique datasets of COVID-19 and AD-COVID-19 patient fatality predictions. This proposed model achieved 97% accuracy, 97% precision, 97% recall, and 97% F1-score for Dataset I; 97% accuracy, 97% precision, 96% recall, and 96% F1-score for Dataset II; and 86% accuracy, 88% precision, 88% recall, and 86% F1-score for Dataset III. In addition, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest models were utilized to evaluate the risk factors associated with AD-COVID-19 patients, and the outcome outperformed diagnostic performance. The risk factors predicted by the models showed significant clinical importance and relevance to mortality. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid model's performance was evaluated using a statistical significance test and compared to previously published works. Overall, the uniqueness of the large dataset, the effectiveness of the deep learning architecture, and the accuracy and performance of the hybrid model showcase the first cohesive work that can formulate better predictions and help in clinical decision-making.},

Towards this end, we firstly employed Bayesian optimization to tune the Gaussian process regression (GPR) hyperparameters to develop an efficient GPR-based model for forecasting the recovered and confirmed COVID-19 cases in two highly impacted countries, India and Brazil. However, machine learning models do not consider the time dependency in the COVID-19 data series. Here, dynamic information has been taken into account to alleviate this limitation by introducing lagged measurements in constructing the investigated machine learning models. Additionally, we assessed the contribution of the incorporated features to the COVID-19 prediction using the Random Forest algorithm. Results reveal that significant improvement can be obtained using the proposed dynamic machine learning models. In addition, the results highlighted the superior performance of the dynamic GPR compared to the other models (i.e., Support vector regression, Boosted trees, Bagged trees, Decision tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost) by achieving an averaged mean absolute percentage error of around 0.1%. Finally, we provided the confidence level of the predicted results based on the dynamic GPR model and showed that the predictions are within the 95% confidence interval.

The current study proposes multi-regional modeling of CCC cases for the first scenario using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) based on automatic routines (AUTOARIMA), ARIMA with maximum likelihood (ARIMAML), and ARIMA with generalized least squares method (ARIMAGLS) and ensembled (ARIMAML-ARIMAGLS). Subsequently, different deep learning (DL) models viz: long short-term memory (LSTM), random forest (RF), and ensemble learning (EML) were applied to the second scenario to predict the effect of forest knowledge (FK) during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips–Perron (PP) unit root tests, autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), Schwarz information criterion (SIC), and residual diagnostics were considered in determining the best ARIMA model for cumulative COVID-19 cases (CCC) across multi-region countries. Seven different performance criteria were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The obtained results justified both types of ARIMA model, with ARIMAGLS and ensemble ARIMA demonstrating superiority to the other models. Among the DL models analyzed, LSTM-M1 emerged as the best and most reliable estimation model, with both RF and LSTM attaining more than 80% prediction accuracy. While the EML of the DL proved merit with 96% accuracy. The outcomes of the two scenarios indicate the superiority of ARIMA time series and DL models in further decision making for FK.</p>},

In this study, we have used public datasets provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for developing a prediction model for the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak to and throughout Malaysia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. We have made use of certain effective deep learning (DL) models for this purpose. We assessed some specific major features for predicting the trend of the existing COVID-19 outbreak in these three countries. In this study, we also proposed a DL approach that includes recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for predicting the probable numbers of COVID-19 cases. The LSTM models showed a 98.58% precision accuracy while the RNN models showed a 93.45% precision accuracy. Also, this study compared the number of coronavirus cases and the number of resulting deaths in Malaysia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. Thereafter, we predicted the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for a subsequent seven days. In this study, we presented their predictions using the data that was available up to December 3rd, 2020.},

Thus, this study aimed to examine and predict the factors affecting the adoption of Tawakkalna CTA. An integrated model which comprises the technology acceptance model (TAM), privacy calculus theory (PCT), and task-technology fit (TTF) model was hypothesized. The model is used to understand better behavioral intention toward using the Tawakkalna mobile CTA. This study performed structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis as well as artificial neural network (ANN) analysis to validate the model, using survey data from 309 users of CTAs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The findings revealed that perceived ease of use and usefulness has positively and significantly impacted the behavioral intention of Tawakkalna mobile CTA. Similarly, task features and mobility positively and significantly influence task-technology fit, and significantly affect the behavioral intention of the CTA. However, the privacy risk, social concerns, and perceived benefits of social interaction are not significant factors. The findings provide adequate knowledge of the relative impact of key predictors of the behavioral intention of the Tawakkalna contact-tracing app.</p>},

The pandemic is spreading unprecedently in Addis Ababa, which results in extraordinary logistical and management challenges in response to the novel coronavirus in the city. Thus, management strategies and resource allocation need to be vulnerability-oriented. Though various studies have been carried out on COVID-19, only a few studies have been conducted on vulnerability from a geospatial/location-based perspective but at a wider spatial resolution. This puts the results of those studies under question while their findings are projected to the finer spatial resolution. To overcome such problems, the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has been developed as a framework to evaluate and map the susceptibility status of the infection risk to COVID-19. To achieve the objective of the study, data like land use, population density, and distance from roads, hospitals, bus stations, the bank, markets, COVID-19 cases, health care units, and government offices are used. The weighted overlay method was used; to evaluate and map the susceptibility status of the infection risk to COVID-19. The result revealed that out of the total study area, 32.62% (169.91 km2) falls under the low vulnerable category (1), and the area covering 40.9% (213.04 km2) under the moderate vulnerable class (2) for infection risk of COVID-19. The highly vulnerable category (3) covers an area of 25.31% (132.85 km2), and the remaining 1.17% (6.12 km2) is under an extremely high vulnerable class (4). Thus, these priority areas could address pandemic control mechanisms like disinfection regularly. Health sector professionals, local authorities, the scientific community, and the general public will benefit from the study as a tool to better understand pandemic transmission centers and identify areas where more protective measures and response actions are needed at a finer spatial resolution.</p>},

   abstract = {Quantifying and analyzing excess mortality in crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for policymakers. Traditional measures fail to take into account differences in the level, long-term secular trends, and seasonal patterns in all-cause mortality across countries and regions. This paper develops and empirically investigates the forecasting performance of a novel, flexible and dynamic ensemble learning with a model selection strategy (DELMS) for the seasonal time series forecasting of monthly respiratory disease death data across a pool of 61 heterogeneous countries. The strategy is based on a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) of heterogeneous time series methods involving both the selection of the subset of best forecasters (model confidence set), the identification of the best holdout period for each contributed model, and the determination of optimal weights using out-of-sample predictive accuracy. A model selection strategy is also developed to remove the outlier models and to combine the models with reasonable accuracy in the ensemble. The empirical outcomes of this large set of experiments show that the accuracy of the BMA approach is significantly improved with DELMS when selecting a flexible and dynamic holdout period and removing the outlier models. Additionally, the forecasts of respiratory disease deaths for each country are highly accurate and exhibit a high correlation (94%) with COVID-19 deaths in 2020.},

   abstract = {The pandemic emergency caused by the spread of COVID-19 has stressed the importance of promptly identifying new epidemic clusters and patterns, to ensure the implementation of local risk containment measures and provide the needed healthcare to the population. In this framework, artificial intelligence, GIS, geospatial analysis and space assets can play a crucial role. Social media analytics can be used to trigger Earth Observation (EO) satellite acquisitions over potential new areas of human aggregation. Similarly, EO satellites can be used jointly with social media analytics to systematically monitor well-known areas of aggregation (green urban areas, public markets, etc.). The information that can be obtained from the Earth Cognitive System 4 COVID-19 (ECO4CO) are both predictive, aiming to identify possible new clusters of outbreaks, and at the same time supervisorial, by monitoring infrastructures (i.e. traffic jams, parking lots) or specific categories (i.e. teenagers, doctors, teachers, etc.). In this perspective, the technologies described in this paper will allow us to detect critical areas where individuals can be involved in risky aggregation clusters. The ECO4CO data lake will be integrated with ad hoc data obtained by health care structures to understand trends and dynamics, to assess criticalities with respect to medical response and supplies, and to test possibilities useful to tackle potential future emergencies. The System will also provide geographical information on the spread of the infection which will allow an appropriate context-specific public health response to the epidemic. This project has been co-funded by the European Space Agency under its Business Applications programme.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is one of the largest spreading pandemic diseases faced in the documented history of mankind. Human to human interaction is the most prolific method of transmission of this virus. Nations all across the globe started to issue stay at home orders and mandating to wear masks or a form of face-covering in public to minimize the transmission by reducing contact between majority of the populace. The epidemiological models used in the literature have considerable drawbacks in the assumption of homogeneous mixing among the populace. Moreover, the effect of mitigation strategies such as mask mandate and stay at home orders cannot be efficiently accounted for in these models. In this work, we propose a novel data driven approach using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neural network model to form a functional mapping of daily new confirmed cases with mobility data which has been quantified from cell phone traffic information and mask mandate information. With this approach no pre-defined equations are used to predict the spread, no homogeneous mixing assumption is made, and the effect of mitigation strategies can be accounted for. The model learns the spread of the virus based on factual data from verified resources. A study of the number of cases for the state of New York (NY) and state of Florida (FL) in the USA are performed using the model. The model correctly predicts that with higher mobility the cases would increase and vice-versa. It further predicts the rate of new cases would see a decline if a mask mandate is administered. Both these predictions are in agreement with the opinions of leading medical and immunological experts. The model also predicts that with the mask mandate option even a higher mobility would reduce the daily cases than lower mobility without masks. We additionally generate results and provide RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) comparison with ARIMA based model of other published work for Italy, Turkey, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Japan, and the UK. Our model reports lower RMSE than the ARIMA based work for all eight countries which were tested. The proposed model would provide administrations with a quantifiable basis of how mobility, mask mandates are related to new confirmed cases; so far no epidemiological models provide that information. It gives fast and relatively accurate prediction of the number of cases and would enable the administrations to make informed decisions and make plans for mitigation strategies and changes in hospital resources.},

   abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is leading to the discovery of hundreds of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants on a daily basis. While most variants do not impact the course of the pandemic, some variants pose significantly increased risk when the acquired mutations allow better evasion of antibody neutralisation in previously infected or vaccinated subjects, or increased transmissibility. Early detection of such high risk variants (HRVs) is paramount for the proper management of the pandemic. However, experimental assays to determine immune evasion and transmissibility characteristics of new variants are resource-intensive and time-consuming, potentially leading to delayed appropriate responses by decision makers. Here we present a novel in silico approach combining Spike protein structure modelling and large protein transformer language models on Spike protein sequences, to accurately rank SARS-CoV-2 variants for immune escape and fitness potential. We validate our immune escape and fitness metrics with in vitro pVNT and binding assays. These metrics can be combined into an automated Early Warning System (EWS) capable of evaluating new variants in minutes and risk monitoring variant lineages in near real-time. The EWS flagged 12 out of 13 variants, designated by the World Health Organisation (WHO, Alpha-Omicron) as potentially dangerous, on average two months ahead of them being designated as such, demonstrating its ability to help increase preparedness against future variants. Omicron was flagged by the EWS on the day its sequence was made available, with immune evasion and binding metrics subsequently confirmed through our in vitro experiments.One-Sentence Summary A COVID-19 Early Warning System combining structural modelling with AI to detect and monitor high risk SARS-CoV-2 variants, identifying &gt;90% of WHO designated variants on average two months in advance.Competing Interest StatementU.S. is a management board member and employee at BioNTech SE.

   abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had and continues to pose a significant threat to global health. We propose a predictive model based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) that investigates the influence of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the progression of COVID-19. The proposed model is validated by case studies for multiple states in the United States. It should be noted that the proposed model can be generalized to other regions of interest. The results show that the predictive model can achieve accurate forecasts across the US. The forecast is then utilized to identify the optimal mitigation policies. The goal is to identify the best stringency level for each policy that can minimize the total number of new COVID-19 cases while minimizing the mitigation costs. A meta-heuristics method, named multi-population evolutionary algorithm with differential evolution (MPEA-DE), has been developed to identify optimal mitigation strategies that minimize COVID-19 infection cases while reducing economic and other negative implications. We compared the optimal mitigation strategies identified by the MPEA-DE model with three baseline search strategies. The results show that MPEA-DE performs better than other baseline models based on prescription dominance.},

The early identification of mutations that could confer adaptive advantages to the virus, such as higher infectivity or immune evasion, is of paramount importance. However, the large number of currently available genomes precludes the efficient use of phylogeny-based methods. Here we establish a fast and scalable early warning system based on Topological Data Analysis for the identification and surveillance of emerging adaptive mutations in large genomic datasets. Analyzing millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID, we demonstrate that topologically salient mutations are linked with an increase in infectivity or immune escape. We report on emerging potentially adaptive mutations as of January 2022, and pinpoint mutations in Variants of Concern that are likely due to convergent evolution. Our approach can improve the surveillance of mutations of concern, guide experimental studies, and aid vaccine development.Competing Interest StatementRaul Rabadan is a founder of Genotwin, he is member of the Scientific Advisory Board of AimedBio and consults for Arquimea Research.Funding StatementThe authors acknowledge the use of de.NBI Cloud and the support by the High Performance and Cloud Computing Group at the Zentrum für Datenverarbeitung of the University of Tübingen and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through grant no 031 A535A.

As the natural next step we employ (near) scale invariance to organise the time evolution of the competing variants within the effective description of the epidemic Renormalisation Group framework.

These uncertainties have led to instabilities in several facets of society, most notably health, economy and public order. Measures to contain the pandemic by governments have occasionally met with increasing discontent from societies and have triggered social unrest, imposing serious threats to human security.

   abstract = {<p>Since the United States started grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in the world as of August 2020, most states have enforced travel restrictions resulting in drastic reductions in mobility and travel. However, the long-term implications of this crisis to mobility still remain uncertain. To this end, this study proposes an analytical framework that determines the most significant factors affecting human mobility in the United States during the early days of the pandemic. Particularly, the study uses least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization to identify the most significant variables influencing human mobility and uses linear regularization algorithms, including ridge, LASSO, and elastic net modeling techniques, to predict human mobility. State-level data were obtained from various sources from January 1, 2020 to June 13, 2020. The entire data set was divided into a training and a test data set, and the variables selected by LASSO were used to train models by the linear regularization algorithms, using the training data set. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the developed models was examined on the test data. The results indicate that several factors, including the number of new cases, social distancing, stay-at-home orders, domestic travel restrictions, mask-wearing policy, socioeconomic status, unemployment rate, transit mode share, percent of population working from home, and percent of older (60+ years) and African and Hispanic American populations, among others, significantly influence daily trips. Moreover, among all models, ridge regression provides the most superior performance with the least error, whereas both LASSO and elastic net performed better than the ordinary linear model.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have major impact to health and medical infrastructure, economy, and agriculture. Prominent computational and mathematical models have been unreliable due to the complexity of the spread of infections. Moreover, lack of data collection and reporting makes modelling attempts difficult and unreliable. Hence, we need to re-look at the situation with reliable data sources and innovative forecasting models. Deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks are well suited for modelling spatiotemporal sequences. In this paper, we apply recurrent neural networks such as long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and encoder-decoder LSTM models for multi-step (short-term) COVID-19 infection forecasting. We select Indian states with COVID-19 hotpots and capture the first (2020) and second (2021) wave of infections and provide two months ahead forecast. Our model predicts that the likelihood of another wave of infections in October and November 2021 is low; however, the authorities need to be vigilant given emerging variants of the virus. The accuracy of the predictions motivate the application of the method in other countries and regions. Nevertheless, the challenges in modelling remain due to the reliability of data and difficulties in capturing factors such as population density, logistics, and social aspects such as culture and lifestyle.</p>},

Dozens of case predictions models have been proposed but their accuracy over time and by model type remains unclear. In this study, we analyze all US CDC COVID-19 forecasting models, by first categorizing them and then calculating their mean absolute percent error, both wave-wise and on the complete timeline. We compare their estimates to government-reported case numbers, one another, as well as two baseline models wherein case counts remain static or follow a simple linear trend. The comparison reveals that more than one-third of models fail to outperform a simple static case baseline and two-thirds fail to outperform a simple linear trend forecast. A wave-by-wave comparison of models revealed that no overall modeling approach was superior to others, including ensemble models, and error in modeling has increased over time during the pandemic. This study raises concerns about hosting these models on official public platforms of health organizations including the US-CDC which risks giving them an official imprimatur and further raising concerns if utilized to formulate policy. By offering a universal evaluation method for pandemic forecasting models, we expect this work to serve as the starting point towards the development of more accurate models.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Without existing protective immunity, an EID may spread rapidly and cause mass casualties in a very short time. Therefore, it is imperative to identify cases with risk of disease progression for the optimized allocation of medical resources in case medical facilities are overwhelmed with a flood of patients. This study has aimed to cope with this challenge from the aspect of preventive medicine by exploiting machine learning technologies. The study has been based on 83,227 hospital admissions with influenza-like illness and we analysed the risk effects of 19 comorbidities along with age and gender for severe illness or mortality risk. The experimental results revealed that the decision rules derived from the machine learning based prediction models can provide valuable guidelines for the healthcare policy makers to develop an effective vaccination strategy. Furthermore, in case the healthcare facilities are overwhelmed by patients with EID, which frequently occurred in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the frontline physicians can incorporate the proposed prediction models to triage patients suffering minor symptoms without laboratory tests, which may become scarce during an EID disaster. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated an effective approach to exploit machine learning technologies to cope with the challenges faced during the outbreak of an EID.},

This ABS provides information about risk and the effects of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, as well as detailed control over the rapidly evolving epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Simulation results can inform decisions made by facility administrators and be used as inputs for a complementary decision support system.

   abstract = {Predicting the evolution of the current epidemic depends significantly on understanding the nature of the underlying stochastic processes. To unravel the global features of these processes, we analyse the world data of SARS-CoV-2 infection events, scrutinising two eight-month periods associated with the epidemics outbreak and initial immunisation phase. Based on the correlation-network mapping, K-means clustering, and multifractal time series analysis, our results reveal universal patterns, suggesting potential predominant drivers of the pandemic. More precisely, the Laplacian eigenvectors localisation has revealed robust communities of different countries and regions that then cluster according to similar shapes of infection fluctuations. Apart from quantitative measures, the immunisation phase differs significantly from the epidemic outbreak by the countries and regions constituting each cluster. While the similarity grouping possesses some regional components, the appearance of large clusters spanning different geographic locations is persevering. Furthermore, cyclic trends are characteristic of the identified clusters, dominating large temporal fluctuations of infection evolution, which are prominent in the immunisation phase. Meanwhile, persistent fluctuations around the local trend occur in intervals smaller than 14 days. These results provide a basis for further research into the interplay between biological and social factors as the primary cause of infection cycles and a better understanding of the impact of socio-economical and environmental factors at different phases of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statementthe Slovenian Research Agency; the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia; the NSERC and the CRC Program Canada;Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study involves only openly available human data, which can be obtained from the Johns Hopkins University: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/githubI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In summary, the proposed hybrid system methodology consists of two steps. In the first step, an ARIMA model is used to analyze the linear part of the problem. In the second step, a neural network model is developed to model the residuals of the ARIMA model, which would be the non-linear part of it. The neural network model was superior to the ARIMA when considering the capture of weekly seasonality and in two weeks, the combination of models with the capture of seasonality in two weeks provided a mixed model with good error metrics, that allows actions to be premeditated with greater certainty, such as increasing the number of nurses in a location, or the acceleration of vaccination campaigns to diminish a possible increase in the number of cases.},

In the face of a volatile crisis, modeling efforts have had to evolve over time in proposing policies for pandemic interventions. In this paper, we document how mathematical modeling contributed to guiding the trajectory of pandemic policies in the Philippines. We present the mathematical specifications of the FASSSTER COVID-19 compartmental model at the core of the FASSSTER platform, the scenario-based disease modeling and analytics toolkit used in the Philippines. We trace how evolving epidemiological analysis at the national, regional, and provincial levels guided government actions; and conversely, how emergent policy questions prompted subsequent model development and analysis. At various stages of the pandemic, simulated outputs of the FASSSTER model strongly correlated with empirically observed case trajectories (

). Model simulations were subsequently utilized to predict the outcomes of proposed interventions, including the calibration of community quarantine levels alongside improvements to healthcare system capacity. This study shows how the FASSSTER model enabled the implementation of a phased approach toward gradually expanding economic activity while limiting the spread of COVID-19. This work points to the importance of locally contextualized, flexible, and responsive mathematical modeling, as applied to pandemic intelligence and for data-driven policy-making in general.},

In this article, a modified version of the well-known mathematical epidemic model susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) is used to analyze the epidemic's course of COVID-19 in eight different countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). To achieve this goal, the parameters of the SIR model are identified by using publicly available data for the corresponding countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Based on the prediction model, we estimated the epidemic trend of COVID-19 outbreak in SAARC countries for 20, 90, and 180 days, respectively. A short-mid-long term prediction model has been designed to understand the early dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in the southeast Asian region. The maximum and minimum basic reproduction numbers (R0 = 1.33 and 1.07) for SAARC countries are predicted to be in Pakistan and Bhutan. We equate simulation results with real data in the SAARC countries on the COVID-19 outbreak, and predicted different scenarios using the modified SIR prediction model. Our results should provide policymakers with a method for evaluating the impacts of possible interventions, including lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracking.},

Because of increasing number of cases day by day, it takes time to interpret the data thus the limitations in terms of both treatment and findings are emerged. Due to such limitations, the need for clinical decisions making system with predictive algorithms has arisen. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying the diseases. In this study, we design clinical predictive models that estimate, using artificial intelligence and data, which patients are susceptible to receive a COVID-19 disease. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, accuracy, AUROC, and scores calculated. From 12,727 individuals, models were tested with basic information (sex, age) and the patient’s type of case, which is the combination of their symptoms, their travel during the last 14 days, their contact with an infected person or their participation in a festival requiring a gathering. We used 5 machine learning algorithms (LR, SVM, k-NN, RF, XGBoost) and 1 deep learning algorithm (ANN). Our models were validated with train-test split approach. The experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify patients that have COVID-19 disease at an accuracy of 73% and AUC of 69%. It is observed that predictive models trained on patients’ basic information and type of case could be used to predict COVID-19 infection in Senegal and can be helpful for medical experts to optimize the resources efficiently.},

Thus, they are complementary to the forecasts obtained from epidemiological models. The forecasts are based on extracting trends from windows of data using machine learning and then computing the forecasts by applying some constraints to the flexible extracted trend. These methods have been applied previously to various other time series data and they performed well.

   abstract = {COVID-19 has affected every individual physically or physiologically, leading to substantial impacts on how they perceive and respond to the pandemic’s danger. Due to the lack of vaccines or effective medicines to cure the infection, an urgent control measure is required to prevent the continued spread of COVID-19. This can be achieved using advanced computing, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), cloud computing, and edge computing. To control the exponential spread of the novel virus, it is crucial for countries to contain and mitigate interventions. To prevent exponential growth, several control measures have been applied in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. As the pandemic has been spreading globally for more than a year, an ample amount of data is available for researchers to predict and forecast the effect of the pandemic in the near future. This article interprets the effects of COVID-19 using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR-F) while F-stands for ‘Fatal with confirmation,’ age-structured SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed) and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of citizens of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, it examines the different control measure scenarios produced by the modified SEIR model. The evolution of the simulation results shows that the interventions are vital to flatten the virus spread curve, which can delay the peak and decrease the fatality rate.},

   abstract = {The widespread lockdowns imposed in many countries at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic elevated the importance of research on pandemic management when medical solutions such as vaccines are unavailable. We present a framework that combines a standard epidemiological SEIR (susceptible–exposed–infected–removed) model with an equally standard machine learning classification model for clinical severity risk, defined as an individual's risk of needing intensive care unit (ICU) treatment if infected. Using COVID-19–related data and estimates for France as of spring 2020, we then simulate isolation and exit policies. Our simulations show that policies considering clinical risk predictions could relax isolation restrictions for millions of the lowest risk population months earlier while consistently abiding by ICU capacity restrictions. Exit policies without risk predictions, meanwhile, would considerably exceed ICU capacity or require the isolation of a substantial portion of population for over a year in order to not overwhelm the medical system. Sensitivity analyses further decompose the impact of various elements of our models on the observed effects. Our work indicates that predictive modeling based on machine learning and artificial intelligence could bring significant value to managing pandemics. Such a strategy, however, requires governments to develop policies and invest in infrastructure to operationalize personalized isolation and exit policies based on risk predictions at scale. This includes health data policies to train predictive models and apply them to all residents, as well as policies for targeted resource allocation to maintain strict isolation for high-risk individuals.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is a contagious disease; so, predicting its future infections in a provincial region requires the consideration of the related data (i.e., rates of infection, mortality and recovery, etc.) over a period of time. Clearly, the COVID-19 data of a particular provincial region can be easily modelled as a time-series. However, predicting the future COVID-19 infections in a particular region is quite challenging when the availability of COVID-19 dataset of the province is of little quantity. Accordingly, ML models when deployed for such tasks usually results in low infection prediction accuracy. To overcome such issues of low variance and high bias in a model due to data scarcity, multi-source transfer learning (MSTL) along with deep learning may be quite useful and effective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel technique based on multi-source deep transfer learning (MSDTL) to efficiently forecast the future COVID-19 infections in the provinces with insufficient COVID-19 data. The proposed approach is a novel contribution as it considers the fact that future COVID-19 transmission in a region also depends on its population density and economic conditions (GDP) for accurate forecasting of the infections to tackle the pandemic efficiently. The importance of this feature selection is experimentally proved in this paper. Our proposed approach employs the well-known recurrent neural network architecture, the Long-short term memory (LSTM), a popular deep-learning model for history-dependent tasks. A comparative analysis has been performed with existing state-of-art algorithms to portray the efficiency of LSTM. Thus, formation of MSDTL approach enhances the predictive precision capability of the LSTM. We evaluate the proposed methodology over the COVID-19 dataset from sixty-two provinces belonging to different nations. We then empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using two different evaluation metrics, viz. The mean absolute percentage error and the coefficient of determination. We show that our proposed MSDTL based approach is better in terms of the accuracy of the future infection prediction, and produces improvements up to 96% over its without-TL counterpart.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Modeling on infectious diseases is significant to facilitate public health policymaking. There are two main mathematical methods that can be used for the simulation of the epidemic and prediction of optimal early warning timing: the logistic differential equation (LDE) model and the more complex generalized logistic differential equation (GLDE) model. This study aimed to compare and analyze these two models. Methods: We collected data on (coronavirus disease 2019) COVID-19 and four other infectious diseases and classified the data into four categories: different transmission routes, different epidemic intensities, different time scales, and different regions, using R2 to compare and analyze the goodness-of-fit of LDE and GLDE models. Results: Both models fitted the epidemic curves well, and all results were statistically significant. The R2 test value of COVID-19 was 0.924 (p < 0.001) fitted by the GLDE model and 0.916 (p < 0.001) fitted by the LDE model. The R2 test value varied between 0.793 and 0.966 fitted by the GLDE model and varied between 0.594 and 0.922 fitted by the LDE model for diseases with different transmission routes. The R2 test values varied between 0.853 and 0.939 fitted by the GLDE model and varied from 0.687 to 0.769 fitted by the LDE model for diseases with different prevalence intensities. The R2 test value varied between 0.706 and 0.917 fitted by the GLDE model and varied between 0.410 and 0.898 fitted by the LDE model for diseases with different time scales. The GLDE model also performed better with nation-level data with the R2 test values between 0.897 and 0.970 vs. 0.731 and 0.953 that fitted by the LDE model. Both models could characterize the patterns of the epidemics well and calculate the acceleration weeks. Conclusion: The GLDE model provides more accurate goodness-of-fit to the data than the LDE model. The GLDE model is able to handle asymmetric data by introducing shape parameters that allow it to fit data with various distributions. The LDE model provides an earlier epidemic acceleration week than the GLDE model. We conclude that the GLDE model is more advantageous in asymmetric infectious disease data simulation.},

ARIMA models with minimum Akaike Information Criterion Correction (AICc) and statistically significant parameters were chosen as the best models in this research. Accordingly, for the new confirmed cases, ARIMA (3,1,14), ARIMA (0,1,11), ARIMA (1,0,10), and ARIMA (1,1,14) models were chosen for the UK, South Africa, Brazil, and Nigeria, respectively. Also, the model specification for the confirmed death cases was ARIMA (3,0,4), ARIMA (0,1,4), ARIMA (1,0,7), and ARIMA (Brown); models were selected for the UK, South Africa, Brazil, and Nigeria, respectively.

The main idea is to study the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak at the first stage and then provide efficient insights to estimate the necessary resources accordingly. The convex RO with Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) objective function is utilized to project the course of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. To validate the performance of the suggested model, a real-case study is investigated and compared to several well-known forecasting models including Simple Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, Weighted Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing with Trend Adjustment models. Furthermore, the effect of parameter uncertainties is examined using a set of sensitivity analyses. The results demonstrate that by increasing the degree (coefficient) of regression up to 8, MAD value decreases to 1378.12, and consequently, the corresponding equation becomes more accurate. On the other hand, from the 8th degree onwards, MAD value follows an upward trend. Furthermore, by increasing the level of regression uncertainty, MAD value follows a downward trend to reach 1309.28 and the estimation accuracy of the model increases accordingly. Finally, our proposed model achieves the least MAD and the greatest correlation coefficient against the other models.},

   abstract = {<p>The COVID-19 has wreaked havoc upon the world with over 248 million confirmed cases and a death toll of over 5 million. It is alarming that the United States contributes over 18% of these confirmed cases and 14% of the deaths. Researchers have proposed many forecasting models to predict the spread of COVID-19 at the national, state, and county levels. However, due to the large variety in the mitigation policies adopted by various state and local governments; and unpredictable social events during the pandemic, it is incredibly challenging to develop models that can provide accurate long-term forecasting for disease spread. In this paper, to address such a challenge, we introduce a new multi-period curve fitting model to give a short-term prediction of the COVID-19 spread in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) within the United States. Since most counties/cities within a single MSA usually adopt similar mitigation strategies, this allows us to substantially diminish the variety in adopted mitigation strategies within an MSA. At the same time, the multi-period framework enables us to incorporate the impact of significant social events and mitigation strategies in the model. We also propose a simple heuristic to estimate the COVID-19 fatality based on our spread prediction. Numerical experiments show that the proposed multi-period curve model achieves reasonably high accuracy in the prediction of the confirmed cases and fatality.</p>},

Demeanor vital data will help in executing policies to reduce the number of cases efficiently. Filtering techniques are appropriate for dynamic model structures as it provide reasonable estimates over the recursive Bayesian updates. Kalman Filters, used for controlling epidemics, are valuable in knowing contagious infections. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have generally been used for classification and forecasting problems. ANN models show an essential role in several successful applications of neural networks and are commonly used in economic and business studies. Long short-term memory (LSTM) model is one of the most popular technique used in time series analysis. This paper aims to forecast COVID-19 on the basis of ANN, KF, LSTM and SVM methods. We applied ANN, KF, LSTM and SVM for the COVID-19 data in Pakistan to find the number of deaths, confirm cases, and cases of recovery. The three methods were used for prediction, and the results showed the performance of LSTM to be better than that of ANN and KF method. ANN, KF, LSTM and SVM endorsed the COVID-19 data in closely all three scenarios. LSTM, ANN and KF followed the fluctuations of the original data and made close COVID-19 predictions. The results of the three methods helped significantly in the decision-making direction for short term strategies and in the control of the COVID-19 outbreak.},

   abstract = {The control of the initial outbreak and spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 via the application of population-wide non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures have led to remarkable successes in dampening the pandemic globally. However, with countries beginning to ease or lift these measures fully to restart activities, concern is growing regarding the impacts that such reopening of societies could have on the subsequent transmission of the virus. While mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission have played important roles in evaluating the impacts of these measures for curbing virus transmission, a key need is for models that are able to effectively capture the effects of the spatial and social heterogeneities that drive the epidemic dynamics observed at the local community level. Iterative forecasting that uses new incoming epidemiological and social behavioral data to sequentially update locally-applicable transmission models can overcome this gap, potentially resulting in better predictions and policy actions. Here, we present the development of one such data-driven iterative modelling tool based on publicly available data and an extended SEIR model for forecasting SARS-CoV-2 at the county level in the United States. Using data from the state of Florida, we demonstrate the utility of such a system for exploring the outcomes of the social measures proposed by policy makers for containing the course of the pandemic. We provide comprehensive results showing how the locally identified models could be employed for accessing the impacts and societal tradeoffs of using specific social protective strategies. We conclude that it could have been possible to lift the more disruptive social interventions related to movement restriction/social distancing measures earlier if these were accompanied by widespread testing and contact tracing. These intensified social interventions could have potentially also brought about the control of the epidemic in low- and some medium-incidence county settings first, supporting the development and deployment of a geographically-phased approach to reopening the economy of Florida. We have made our data-driven forecasting system publicly available for policymakers and health officials to use in their own locales, so that a more efficient coordinated strategy for controlling SARS-CoV-2 region-wide can be developed and successfully implemented.},

We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the daily time series of the COVID-19 death cases and confirmed cases for the top 25 countries from April of 2020 to February of 2021. We calculated the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the cross-correlation matrix of the changes in daily accumulated data over monthly time windows. The largest eigenvalue describes the overall evolution dynamics of the COVID-19 and indicates that evolution was faster in April of 2020 than in any other period. By using the first two PC coefficients, we can identify the group dynamics of the COVID-19 evolution. We observed groups under critical states in the loading plot and found that American and European countries are represented by strong clusters in the loading plot. The first PC plays an important role and the correlations (C <sub>1</sub> ) between the normalized logarithmic changes in deaths or confirmed cases and the first PCs may be used as indicators of different phases of the COVID-19. By varying C <sub>1</sub> over time, we identified different phases of the COVID-19 in the analyzed countries over the target time period. </p>},

   abstract = {Epidemics of infectious diseases, such as the one caused by the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have tested the world's more advanced health systems and have caused an enormous societal and economic damage. The mechanism of contagion is well understood. As people move around, over time, they regularly engage in social interactions. The spatiotemporal network representing these interactions constitutes the backbone on which an epidemic spreads, causing outbreaks. At the same time, advanced technological responses have claimed some success in controlling the epidemic based on digital contact tracing technologies. Motivated by these observations, we design, develop and evaluate a stochastic agent-based SEIR model of epidemic spreading in spatiotemporal networks informed by mobility data of individuals (trajectories). The model focuses on individual variation in mobility patterns that affects the degree of exposure to the disease. Understanding the role that individual nodes play in the process of disease spreading through network effects is fundamental as it allows to (i) assess the risk of infection of individuals, (ii) assess the size of a disease outbreak due to specific individuals, and (iii) assess targeted intervention strategies that aim to control the epidemic spreading. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the model employing COVID-19 as a use case. The results indicate that simple individual-based intervention strategies that exhibit significant network effects can effectively control the spread of an epidemic. We have also demonstrated that targeted interventions can outperform generic intervention strategies. Overall, our work provides an evidence-based data-driven model to support decision making and inform public policy regarding intervention strategies for containing or mitigating the epidemic spread.},

Hence, several strategies such as quarantine of exposed and infected individuals and restricting movement through lockdown of geographical regions have been implemented in most countries. On the other hand, standard SEIR based mathematical models have been developed to understand the disease dynamics of COVID-19, and the proper inclusion of these restrictions is the rate-limiting step for the success of these models. In this work, we have developed a hybrid Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Removed (SEIQR) model to explore the influence of quarantine and lockdown on disease propagation dynamics. The model is multi-compartmental, and it considers everyday variations in lockdown regulations, testing rate and quarantine individuals. Our model predicts a considerable difference in reported and actual recovered and deceased cases in qualitative agreement with recent reports.},

Mathematical models of epidemic are useful tools for assessment of the situation and for providing decision-making support for relevant authorities. We developed and implemented SEIR(MH) model that extends the conventional SEIR model with parameters that define public lockdown (the level and start of lockdown) and the medical system capacity to contain patients. Comparative modeling of four regions in Europe that have similar population sizes and age structures, but different public health systems, was performed: Baden-Württemberg, Lombardy, Belgium, and Switzerland. Modeling suggests that the most effective measure for controlling epidemic is early lockdown (exponential effect), followed by the number of available hospital beds (linear effect if the capacity is insufficient, with diminishing returns when the capacity is sufficient). Dynamic management of lockdown levels is likely to produce better outcomes than strict lockdown.</p>},

The SARS-CoV-2 virus had a significant impact on public health, social issues, and financial issues. Thousands of individuals are infected on a regular basis in India, which is one of the populations most seriously impacted by the pandemic. Despite modern medical and technical technology, predicting the spread of the virus has been extremely difficult. Predictive models have been used by health systems such as hospitals, to get insight into the influence of COVID-19 on outbreaks and possible resources, by minimizing the dangers of transmission. As a result, the main focus of this research is on building a COVID-19 predictive analytic technique. In the Indian dataset, Prophet, ARIMA, and stacked LSTM-GRU models were employed to forecast the number of confirmed and active cases. State-of-the-art models such as the recurrent neural network (RNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), linear regression, polynomial regression, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Prophet were used to compare the outcomes of the prediction. After predictive research, the stacked LSTM-GRU model forecast was found to be more consistent than existing models, with better prediction results. Although the stacked model necessitates a large dataset for training, it aids in creating a higher level of abstraction in the final results and the maximization of the model's memory size. The GRU, on the other hand, assists in vanishing gradient resolution. The study findings reveal that the proposed stacked LSTM and GRU model outperforms all other models in terms of R square and RMSE and that the coupled stacked LSTM and GRU model outperforms all other models in terms of R square and RMSE. This forecasting aids in determining the future transmission paths of the virus.},

In this paper, a integer codification for the CVOA individual is introduced and used for optimizing a novel approach for numerical association rules mining. As an application case, the prediction of earthquakes of large magnitude has been addressed. This kind of events are rare and, therefore, they can be characterized by rules with very high interest or lift and low support. Thus, the algorithm has been applied to the extraction of rules meeting specific criteria in an earthquake data set, provided by the National Geographic Institute of Spain. The results show CVOA as a promising tool for numerical association rules mining, obtaining rules with useful and meaningful information for predicting the occurrence of large earthquakes.},

Modeling results stipulate that the mortality rate increase as the age increase and it is found that most of the death cases belong to the age group 60–80. Cluster-based analysis of age groups is also conducted to analyze the maximum targeted age-groups. An association between positive COVID-19 cases and deceased cases are also presented, with the impact on male and female death cases due to corona.

The asymptotic distribution is shown to be identical to the one derived from the independent observations, whereas the convergence rate ((Formula presented.) in which n is the sample size) is slower than that in the nonlinear mean regression. We numerically estimate the proposed nonlinear modal regression model by the use of a modified modal expectation–maximization (MEM) algorithm in conjunction with Taylor expansion. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to demonstrate the good finite sample (prediction) performance of the newly proposed model. We also construct a specified nonlinear modal regression to match the available daily new cases and new deaths data of the COVID-19 outbreak at the state/region level in the United States, and provide forward predictions up to 130 days ahead (from 24 August 2020 to 31 December 2020). In comparison to the traditional nonlinear regressions, the suggested model can fit the COVID-19 data better and produce more precise predictions. The prediction results indicate that there are systematic differences in spreading distributions among states/regions. For most western and eastern states, they have many serious COVID-19 burdens compared to Midwest. We hope that the built nonlinear modal regression can help policymakers to implement fast actions to curb the spread of the infection, avoid overburdening the health system and understand the development of COVID-19 from some points.},

The performance of differ-ent models was evaluated by using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).Results:Through the fitting and prediction of daily new case data, we reveal that the Prophet model has more advantages in the prediction of the COVID-19 of the USA, which could compose data components and capture peri-odic characteristics when the data changes significantly, while SARIMA is more likely to appear over-fitting in the USA. And the SARIMA model captured a seven-day period hidden in daily COVID-19 new cases from 3 countries. While in the prediction of new cumulative cases, the ARIMA model has a better ability to fit and predict the data with a posi-tive growth trend in different countries(Brazil and India).Conclusions:This study can shed light on understanding the outbreak trends and give an insight into the epide-miological control of these regions. Further, the prediction of the Prophet model showed sufficient accuracy in the daily COVID-19 new cases of the USA. The ARIMA model is suitable for predicting Brazil and India, which can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.Keywords:ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, COVID-19, Epidemiological dynamics prediction},
