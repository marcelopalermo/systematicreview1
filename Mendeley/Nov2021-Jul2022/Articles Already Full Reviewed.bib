   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the economy and businesses and impacted all facets of people’s lives. It is critical to forecast the number of infected cases to make accurate decisions on the necessary measures to control the outbreak. While deep learning models have proved to be effective in this context, time series augmentation can improve their performance. In this paper, we use time series augmentation techniques to create new time series that take into account the characteristics of the original series, which we then use to generate enough samples to fit deep learning models properly. The proposed method is applied in the context of COVID-19 time series forecasting using three deep learning techniques, (1) the long short-term memory, (2) gated recurrent units, and (3) convolutional neural network. In terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error measures, the proposed method significantly improves the performance of long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks. Also, the improvement is average for the gated recurrent units. Finally, we present a summary of the top augmentation model as well as a visual representation of the actual and forecasted data for each country.},

   abstract = {Individuals' flow's fluidifcation in the same way as the thinning of the population's concentration remains among major concerns within the context of the pandemic crisis situations. The recent COVID-19 pandemic crisis is a typical example of the aforementioned where on despite of the containment phases that radically isolate the population but are not applicable persistently, people have to adapt their behavior to new daily-life situations tempering Individuals' stream, avoiding tides, and watering down population's concentration. Crowd evacuation is one of the well-known research domains that can play a pertinent role to face the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, considering the population's concentration thinning within the slant of the “crowd evacuation” paradigm allows managing the flow of the population, and consequently, decreasing the probable number of infected cases. In other words, crowd evacuation modeling and simulation with the aim of better-exploiting individuals' flow allow the study and analysis of different possible outcomes for designing population's concentration thinning strategies. In this article, a new decision-making approach is proposed in order to cope with the aforesaid challenges, which relies on an independent Deep Q Network with an improved SIR model (IDQN-I-SIR). The machine-learning component (i.e., IDQN) is in charge of the agent's movements control and I-SIR (improved “susceptible-infected-recovered” individuals) model is responsible to control the virus spread. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IDQN-I-SIR through a case-study of individuals' flow's management with infected cases' avoidance in an emergency department (often overcrowded in context of a pandemic crisis).},

   abstract = {This study aims to develop an assumption-free data-driven model to accurately forecast COVID-19 spread. Towards this end, we firstly employed Bayesian optimization to tune the Gaussian process regression (GPR) hyperparameters to develop an efficient GPR-based model for forecasting the recovered and confirmed COVID-19 cases in two highly impacted countries, India and Brazil. However, machine learning models do not consider the time dependency in the COVID-19 data series. Here, dynamic information has been taken into account to alleviate this limitation by introducing lagged measurements in constructing the investigated machine learning models. Additionally, we assessed the contribution of the incorporated features to the COVID-19 prediction using the Random Forest algorithm. Results reveal that significant improvement can be obtained using the proposed dynamic machine learning models. In addition, the results highlighted the superior performance of the dynamic GPR compared to the other models (i.e., Support vector regression, Boosted trees, Bagged trees, Decision tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost) by achieving an averaged mean absolute percentage error of around 0.1%. Finally, we provided the confidence level of the predicted results based on the dynamic GPR model and showed that the predictions are within the 95% confidence interval. This study presents a promising shallow and simple approach for predicting COVID-19 spread.},

   abstract = {<p>Reliable modeling of novel commutative cases of COVID-19 (CCC) is essential for determining hospitalization needs and providing the benchmark for health-related policies. The current study proposes multi-regional modeling of CCC cases for the first scenario using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) based on automatic routines (AUTOARIMA), ARIMA with maximum likelihood (ARIMAML), and ARIMA with generalized least squares method (ARIMAGLS) and ensembled (ARIMAML-ARIMAGLS). Subsequently, different deep learning (DL) models viz: long short-term memory (LSTM), random forest (RF), and ensemble learning (EML) were applied to the second scenario to predict the effect of forest knowledge (FK) during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips–Perron (PP) unit root tests, autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), Schwarz information criterion (SIC), and residual diagnostics were considered in determining the best ARIMA model for cumulative COVID-19 cases (CCC) across multi-region countries. Seven different performance criteria were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The obtained results justified both types of ARIMA model, with ARIMAGLS and ensemble ARIMA demonstrating superiority to the other models. Among the DL models analyzed, LSTM-M1 emerged as the best and most reliable estimation model, with both RF and LSTM attaining more than 80% prediction accuracy. While the EML of the DL proved merit with 96% accuracy. The outcomes of the two scenarios indicate the superiority of ARIMA time series and DL models in further decision making for FK.</p>},

Many researchers have, in the past, attempted to predict a COVID outbreak and its effect. Some have regarded time-series variables as primary factors which can affect the onset of infectious diseases like influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this study, we have used public datasets provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for developing a prediction model for the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak to and throughout Malaysia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. We have made use of certain effective deep learning (DL) models for this purpose. We assessed some specific major features for predicting the trend of the existing COVID-19 outbreak in these three countries. In this study, we also proposed a DL approach that includes recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for predicting the probable numbers of COVID-19 cases. The LSTM models showed a 98.58% precision accuracy while the RNN models showed a 93.45% precision accuracy. Also, this study compared the number of coronavirus cases and the number of resulting deaths in Malaysia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. Thereafter, we predicted the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for a subsequent seven days. In this study, we presented their predictions using the data that was available up to December 3rd, 2020.},

   abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had and continues to pose a significant threat to global health. We propose a predictive model based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) that investigates the influence of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the progression of COVID-19. The proposed model is validated by case studies for multiple states in the United States. It should be noted that the proposed model can be generalized to other regions of interest. The results show that the predictive model can achieve accurate forecasts across the US. The forecast is then utilized to identify the optimal mitigation policies. The goal is to identify the best stringency level for each policy that can minimize the total number of new COVID-19 cases while minimizing the mitigation costs. A meta-heuristics method, named multi-population evolutionary algorithm with differential evolution (MPEA-DE), has been developed to identify optimal mitigation strategies that minimize COVID-19 infection cases while reducing economic and other negative implications. We compared the optimal mitigation strategies identified by the MPEA-DE model with three baseline search strategies. The results show that MPEA-DE performs better than other baseline models based on prescription dominance.},

   abstract = {<p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have major impact to health and medical infrastructure, economy, and agriculture. Prominent computational and mathematical models have been unreliable due to the complexity of the spread of infections. Moreover, lack of data collection and reporting makes modelling attempts difficult and unreliable. Hence, we need to re-look at the situation with reliable data sources and innovative forecasting models. Deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks are well suited for modelling spatiotemporal sequences. In this paper, we apply recurrent neural networks such as long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and encoder-decoder LSTM models for multi-step (short-term) COVID-19 infection forecasting. We select Indian states with COVID-19 hotpots and capture the first (2020) and second (2021) wave of infections and provide two months ahead forecast. Our model predicts that the likelihood of another wave of infections in October and November 2021 is low; however, the authorities need to be vigilant given emerging variants of the virus. The accuracy of the predictions motivate the application of the method in other countries and regions. Nevertheless, the challenges in modelling remain due to the reliability of data and difficulties in capturing factors such as population density, logistics, and social aspects such as culture and lifestyle.</p>},

The cumulative number of confirmed Covid-19-affected patients forecasted over the three months was between 9,189,262 – 14,906,483 worldwide. This prediction value of Covid 19-affected patients will be valid only if the situation remains unchanged, and the epidemic spreads according to the previous nature worldwide in these three months.},

In summary, the proposed hybrid system methodology consists of two steps. In the first step, an ARIMA model is used to analyze the linear part of the problem. In the second step, a neural network model is developed to model the residuals of the ARIMA model, which would be the non-linear part of it. The neural network model was superior to the ARIMA when considering the capture of weekly seasonality and in two weeks, the combination of models with the capture of seasonality in two weeks provided a mixed model with good error metrics, that allows actions to be premeditated with greater certainty, such as increasing the number of nurses in a location, or the acceleration of vaccination campaigns to diminish a possible increase in the number of cases.},

They assume that the underlying trend is informative regarding short-term developments but without requiring other assumptions about how the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is spreading, or whether preventative policies are effective. Thus, they are complementary to the forecasts obtained from epidemiological models. The forecasts are based on extracting trends from windows of data using machine learning and then computing the forecasts by applying some constraints to the flexible extracted trend. These methods have been applied previously to various other time series data and they performed well. They have also proved effective in the COVID-19 setting where they provided better forecasts than some epidemiological models in the earlier stages of the pandemic.},

We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the daily time series of the COVID-19 death cases and confirmed cases for the top 25 countries from April of 2020 to February of 2021. We calculated the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the cross-correlation matrix of the changes in daily accumulated data over monthly time windows. The largest eigenvalue describes the overall evolution dynamics of the COVID-19 and indicates that evolution was faster in April of 2020 than in any other period. By using the first two PC coefficients, we can identify the group dynamics of the COVID-19 evolution. We observed groups under critical states in the loading plot and found that American and European countries are represented by strong clusters in the loading plot. The first PC plays an important role and the correlations (C <sub>1</sub> ) between the normalized logarithmic changes in deaths or confirmed cases and the first PCs may be used as indicators of different phases of the COVID-19. By varying C <sub>1</sub> over time, we identified different phases of the COVID-19 in the analyzed countries over the target time period. </p>},

The SARS-CoV-2 virus had a significant impact on public health, social issues, and financial issues. Thousands of individuals are infected on a regular basis in India, which is one of the populations most seriously impacted by the pandemic. Despite modern medical and technical technology, predicting the spread of the virus has been extremely difficult. Predictive models have been used by health systems such as hospitals, to get insight into the influence of COVID-19 on outbreaks and possible resources, by minimizing the dangers of transmission. As a result, the main focus of this research is on building a COVID-19 predictive analytic technique. In the Indian dataset, Prophet, ARIMA, and stacked LSTM-GRU models were employed to forecast the number of confirmed and active cases. State-of-the-art models such as the recurrent neural network (RNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), linear regression, polynomial regression, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Prophet were used to compare the outcomes of the prediction. After predictive research, the stacked LSTM-GRU model forecast was found to be more consistent than existing models, with better prediction results. Although the stacked model necessitates a large dataset for training, it aids in creating a higher level of abstraction in the final results and the maximization of the model's memory size. The GRU, on the other hand, assists in vanishing gradient resolution. The study findings reveal that the proposed stacked LSTM and GRU model outperforms all other models in terms of R square and RMSE and that the coupled stacked LSTM and GRU model outperforms all other models in terms of R square and RMSE. This forecasting aids in determining the future transmission paths of the virus.},

The asymptotic distribution is shown to be identical to the one derived from the independent observations, whereas the convergence rate ((Formula presented.) in which n is the sample size) is slower than that in the nonlinear mean regression. We numerically estimate the proposed nonlinear modal regression model by the use of a modified modal expectation–maximization (MEM) algorithm in conjunction with Taylor expansion. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to demonstrate the good finite sample (prediction) performance of the newly proposed model. We also construct a specified nonlinear modal regression to match the available daily new cases and new deaths data of the COVID-19 outbreak at the state/region level in the United States, and provide forward predictions up to 130 days ahead (from 24 August 2020 to 31 December 2020). In comparison to the traditional nonlinear regressions, the suggested model can fit the COVID-19 data better and produce more precise predictions. The prediction results indicate that there are systematic differences in spreading distributions among states/regions. For most western and eastern states, they have many serious COVID-19 burdens compared to Midwest. We hope that the built nonlinear modal regression can help policymakers to implement fast actions to curb the spread of the infection, avoid overburdening the health system and understand the development of COVID-19 from some points.},
