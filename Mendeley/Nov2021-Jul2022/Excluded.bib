   abstract = {In on-grid microgrids, electric vehicles (EVs) have to be efficiently scheduled for cost-effective electricity consumption and network operation. The stochastic nature of the involved parameters along with their large number and correlations make such scheduling a challenging task. This paper aims at identifying pertinent innovative solutions for reducing the relevant total costs of the on-grid EVs within hybrid microgrids. To optimally scale the EVs, a heuristic greedy approach is considered. Unlike most existing scheduling methodologies in the literature, the proposed greedy scheduler is model-free, training-free, and yet efficient. The proposed approach considers different factors such as the electricity price, on-grid EVs state of arrival and departure, and the total revenue to meet the load demands. The greedy-based approach behaves satisfactorily in terms of fulfilling its objective for the hybrid microgrid system, which is established of photovoltaic, wind turbine, and a local utility grid. Meanwhile, the on-grid EVs are being utilized as an energy storage exchange location. A real time hardware-in-the-loop experimentation is comprehensively conducted to maximize the earned profit. Through different uncertainty scenarios, the ability of the proposed greedy approach to obtain a global optimal solution is assessed. A data simulator was developed for the purposes of generating evaluation datasets, which captures uncertainties in the behaviors of the system’s parameters. The greedy-based strategy is considered applicable, scalable, and efficient in terms of total operating expenditures. Furthermore, as EVs penetration became more versatile, total expenses decreased significantly. Using simulated data of an effective operational duration of 500 years, the proposed approach succeeded in cutting down the energy consumption costs by about 50–85%, beating existing state-of-the-arts results. The proposed approach is proved to be tolerant to the large amounts of uncertainties that are involved in the system’s operational data.},

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease that affects healthcare on a global scale and cannot be ignored because of its high fatality rate. Computed tomography (CT) images are presently being employed to assist doctors in detecting COVID-19 in its early stages. In several scenarios, a combination of epidemiological criteria (contact during the incubation period), the existence of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (nucleic acid amplification tests), and clinical imaging-based tests are used to diagnose COVID-19. This method can miss patients and cause more complications. Deep learning is one of the techniques that has been proven to be prominent and reliable in several diagnostic domains involving medical imaging. This study utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), stacked autoencoder, and deep neural network to develop a COVID-19 diagnostic system. In this system, classification undergoes some modification before applying the three CT image techniques to determine normal and COVID-19 cases. A large-scale and challenging CT image dataset was used in the training process of the employed deep learning model and reporting their final performance. Experimental outcomes show that the highest accuracy rate was achieved using the CNN model with an accuracy of 88.30%, a sensitivity of 87.65%, and a specificity of 87.97%. Furthermore, the proposed system has outperformed the current existing state-of-the-art models in detecting the COVID-19 virus using CT images.},

   abstract = {Objective: To develop a 2-stage discrete events simulation (DES) based framework for the evaluation of elective surgery cancellation strategies and resumption scenarios across multiple operational outcomes. Materials and Methods: Study data was derived from the data warehouse and domain knowledge on the operational process of the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore. 34,025 unique cases over 43 operating rooms (ORs) and 18 surgical disciplines performed from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2020 were extracted for the study. A clustering approach was used in stage 1 of the modelling framework to develop the groups of surgeries that followed distinctive postponement patterns. These clusters were then used as inputs for stage 2 where the DES model was used to evaluate alternative phased resumption strategies considering the outcomes of OR utilization, waiting times to surgeries and the time to clear the backlogs. Results: The tool enabled us to understand the elective postponement patterns during the COVID-19 partial lockdown period, and evaluate the best phased resumption strategy. Differences in the performance measures were evaluated based on 95% confidence intervals. The results indicate that two of the gradual phased resumption strategies provided lower peak OR and bed utilizations but required a longer time to return to BAU levels. Minimum peak bed demands could also be reduced by approximately 14 beds daily with the gradual resumption strategy, whilst the maximum peak bed demands by approximately 8.2 beds. Peak OR utilization could be reduced to 92% for gradual resumption as compared to a minimum peak of 94.2% with the full resumption strategy. Conclusions: The 2-stage modelling framework coupled with a user-friendly visualization interface were key enablers for understanding the elective surgery postponement patterns during a partial lockdown phase. The DES model enabled the identification and evaluation of optimal phased resumption policies across multiple important operational outcome measures. Lay abstract: During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, most healthcare systems suspended their non-urgent elective surgery services. This strategy was undertaken as a means to expand surge capacity, through the preservation of structural resources (such as operating theaters, ICU beds, and ventilators), consumables (such as personal protective equipment and medications), and critical healthcare manpower. As a result, some patients had less-essential surgeries postponed due to the pandemic. As the first wave of the pandemic waned, there was an urgent need to quickly develop optimal strategies for the resumption of these surgeries. We developed a 2-stage discrete events simulation (DES) framework based on 34,025 unique cases over 43 operating rooms (ORs) and 18 surgical disciplines performed from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2020 captured in the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) enterprise data warehouse. The outcomes evaluated were OR utilization, waiting times to surgeries and time to clear the backlogs. A user-friendly visualization interface was developed to enable decision makers to determine the most promising surgery resumption strategy across these outcomes. Hospitals globally can make use of the modelling framework to adapt to their own surgical systems to evaluate strategies for postponement and resumption of elective surgeries.},

   abstract = {Aims: The goal of this research is to propose a simpler and more efficient model for evaluating healthcare establishments (HCEs). With this motivation, this study aims to discover key performance indicators (KPIs) that affect HCE performance, present a ranking model for KPIs in Indian HCEs, and evaluate Indian HCEs using the identified and prioritised KPIs. Material and Methods: Through extensive literature review and expert opinions, this research identifies the various KPIs in HCEs, classifies them into six main categories, and prioritises them using the full consistency method (FUCOM). Further, well-known HCEs across northern India were evaluated and ranked using Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to Compromise Solution. Results: The ‘technology adoption related indicators’ is found as the most important main KPIs, whereas ‘adequate number of hospital beds and bathrooms (IE5)' as the most dominating sub-category KPIs. Also, amongst the 20 evaluated Indian HCEs ‘healthcare establishment-1 (HCE1)’ was found to be the best performing HCE while ‘healthcare establishment-12 (HCE12)’ was found to be the worst-performing HCE. The stability and consistency of the results are ascertained by performing sensitivity analysis and comparing the results with other existing methodologies. Conclusion: The findings of this study are quite important for HCEs management to fully comprehend the key areas to improve upon so that managers can improve medical standards in a targeted manner. The developed prioritisation model and methodology shown in this paper will help and motivate managers and intellectuals of HCEs to evaluate and improve the HCE's performance.},

   abstract = {The main aim of the proposed work is to develop the new technique based on decision-theoretical rough sets (DTRSs) and their applications in three-way decision-making problems. This study first develop a fractional fuzzy set (FFS) and their operations, the FFS is a more generalized and accurate tool for describing uncertainty in real-life data information. A new form of decision technique for dealing with the issue of choice based on DTRSs is included in the three-way decisions. The loss function of DTRSs is being used in the proposed decision method model. Initially, the idea of fractional fuzzy α-covering (FF α-covering), fractional fuzzy α–neighborhood (FF α–neighborhood) was introduced. Under the fractional fuzzy state, we integrated the loss function of DTRSs with covering-based fractional fuzzy rough sets. Furthermore, we proposed and established performance characteristics for a new fractional fuzzy α-covering decision-theoretical rough sets model (FFCDTRSs). Then, according to the level of fractional fuzzy numbers (FFN's) positive and negative membership and related three-way decision-making, four methods to solve the expected loss expressed in the form of (FFNs) are described. We have developed a multicriteria decision algorithm (MCDM) based on FFCDTRS. Then an example is used to prove the feasibility of the four methods to solve the MCDM problem. Finally, the results of four distinct decision procedures with various loss functions are compared. The proposed three-way decision-making models are more accurate as compared with particular fuzzy sets.},

For the diagnosis of COVID-19, computed tomography has a prognostic role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 as it provides both rapid and accurate results. This is crucial to assist clinicians in making decisions for rapid isolation and appropriate patient treatment. Therefore, many researchers have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection from chest CT images using various deep learning systems is extremely optimistic. Deep learning networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require substantial training data. One of the biggest problems for researchers is accessing a significant amount of training data. In this work, we combine methods such as segmentation, data augmentation and generative adversarial network (GAN) to increase the effectiveness of deep learning models. We propose a method that generates synthetic chest CT images using the GAN method from a limited number of CT images. We test the performance of experiments (with and without GAN) on internal and external dataset. When the CNN is trained on real images and synthetic images, a slight increase in accuracy and other results are observed in the internal dataset, but between 3% and 9% in the external dataset. It is promising according to the performance results that the proposed method will accelerate the detection of COVID-19 and lead to more robust systems.},

Consequently, the importance of timely prediction and treatment of the disease to reduce transmission and mortality rates cannot be emphasized enough. Various symptoms of the disease have been identified as it progresses from the time it is contracted. COVID-19 has been found to internally affect the lungs, and the four progressive stages of the infection can be categorized as mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Therefore, an accurate analysis of the current stage of the disease that can help predict its progression has become critical. X-ray imaging has been found to be an effective screening procedure for predicting the various stages of this epidemic. Although many different approaches using machine learning, as well as deep learning were utilized to predict and classify diseases in general, till date, such an approach has not been used to predict the various stages of COVID-19 by using X-ray imaging to identify and classify those stages. Materials and method: The proposed hybrid method used three public datasets for its implementation. In this work, extensive images were used for the purposes of testing and training. The dataset-1 consists of 1200 COVID-19 as well as 1200 Non-COVID-19 images, while dataset-2 used 700 COVID-19 as well as 700 Non-COVID-19 images, and finally, dataset-III utilized 1900 COVID-19 as well as 1900 Non-COVID-19 images for purposes of testing and training. The proposed work undertook the task of pre-processing using textual and morphological features, while the segmentation and prediction of COVID-19 as well as Non-COVID-19 images were undertaken using VGG-16 with light GBM for better prediction and handing of huge datasets, and finally, the classification of the various stages of COVID-19 images was performed using Deep Belief Network. Results: The outcomes of the proposed work were subjected to several iterations which were then compared using different parameters such as accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. In general, the prediction and grouping of the various stages of COVID-19 by using affected images were found to be 99.2%, 99.4% and 99.5%, respectively. The bacterial pneumonia prediction rates were observed to be 98.5%, 99.4% and 98.3%, respectively. The average classification of the stages were found to be 98.1%, 98.6% and 98.3%, while the combined multi-classification prediction rates were observed to be 98.6%, 99.1% and 98.7%, respectively.},

It can, however, take days to provide the diagnosis, and false negative rate is relatively high. Imaging, in particular chest computed tomography (CT), can assist with diagnosis and assessment of this disease. Nevertheless, it is shown that standard dose CT scan gives significant radiation burden to patients, especially those in need of multiple scans. In this study, we consider low-dose and ultra-low-dose (LDCT and ULDCT) scan protocols that reduce the radiation exposure close to that of a single X-ray, while maintaining an acceptable resolution for diagnosis purposes. Since thoracic radiology expertise may not be widely available during the pandemic, we develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based framework using a collected dataset of LDCT/ULDCT scans, to study the hypothesis that the AI model can provide human-level performance. The AI model uses a two stage capsule network architecture and can rapidly classify COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia (CAP), and normal cases, using LDCT/ULDCT scans. Based on a cross validation, the AI model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity of 89.5 % ± 0.11 , CAP sensitivity of 95 % ± 0.11 , normal cases sensitivity (specificity) of 85.7 % ± 0.16 , and accuracy of 90 % ± 0.06. By incorporating clinical data (demographic and symptoms), the performance further improves to COVID-19 sensitivity of 94.3 % ± 0.05 , CAP sensitivity of 96.7 % ± 0.07 , normal cases sensitivity (specificity) of 91 % ± 0.09 , and accuracy of 94.1 % ± 0.03. The proposed AI model achieves human-level diagnosis based on the LDCT/ULDCT scans with reduced radiation exposure. We believe that the proposed AI model has the potential to assist the radiologists to accurately and promptly diagnose COVID-19 infection and help control the transmission chain during the pandemic.},

   abstract = {In this study we carried out the early distribution of clades and subclades state-wise based on shared mutations in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected (27th Jan 27th May 2020). Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates indicates multiple independent sources of introduction of the virus in the country, while principal component analysis revealed some state-specific clusters. It is observed that clade 20A defining mutations C241T (ORF1ab: 5 UTR), C3037T (ORF1ab: F924F), C14408T (ORF1ab: P4715L), and A23403G (S: D614G) are predominant in Indian isolates during this period. Higher number of coronavirus cases were observed in certain states, viz., Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. Genetic analysis of isolates from these states revealed a cluster with shared mutations, C6312A (ORF1ab: T2016K), C13730T (ORF1ab: A4489V), C23929T, and C28311T (N: P13L). Analysis of region-specific shared mutations carried out to understand the large number of deaths in Gujarat and Maharashtra identified shared mutations defining subclade, I/GJ-20A (C18877T, C22444T, G25563T (ORF3a: H57Q), C26735T, C28854T (N: S194L), C2836T) in Gujarat and two sets of co-occurring mutations C313T, C5700A (ORF1ab: A1812D) and A29827T, G29830T in Maharashtra. From the genetic analysis of mutation spectra of Indian isolates, the insights gained in its transmission, geographic distribution, containment, and impact are discussed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

It emphasizes the end-to-end digitalization of all physical resources and integrating digital environments with the value chain organizations. Industry 4.0 comprises a variety of technologies such as Cyber-Physical-Systems, Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity. It has been found that the implementation of these technologies may be useful in achieving the objective of legal informatics. It can help lawmakers to align jurisprudence by providing modern computational technologies to improve and advance the traditional legal justice system. Further, the integration of legal informatics with Industry 4.0 will be strengthening the legal justice system by providing decision-making support, data transparency, real-time monitoring, cost-effective solution, and triple-bottom-line performance in the future. Therefore, the article aims to determine the implementation patterns of Industry 4.0 technologies in legislative institutions and administrations. The study proposes a conceptual framework that integrates Industry 4.0 with legal informatics.

   abstract = {The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been holding the world hostage for several years now. Mobility is key to viral spreading and its restriction is the main non-pharmaceutical interventions to fight the virus expansion. Previous works have shown a connection between the structural organization of cities and the movement patterns of their residents. This puts urban centers in the focus of epidemic surveillance and interventions. Here we show that the organization of urban flows has a tremendous impact on disease spreading and on the amenability of different mitigation strategies. By studying anonymous and aggregated intra-urban flows in a variety of cities in the United States and other countries, and a combination of empirical analysis and analytical methods, we demonstrate that the response of cities to epidemic spreading can be roughly classified in two major types according to the overall organization of those flows. Hierarchical cities, where flows are concentrated primarily between mobility hotspots, are particularly vulnerable to the rapid spread of epidemics. Nevertheless, mobility restrictions in such types of cities are very effective in mitigating the spread of a virus. Conversely, in sprawled cities which present many centers of activity, the spread of an epidemic is much slower, but the response to mobility restrictions is much weaker and less effective. Investing resources on early monitoring and prompt ad-hoc interventions in more vulnerable cities may prove helpful in containing and reducing the impact of future pandemics.},

The fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0 includes digitization, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. Industry 4.0 has the potential to fulfil customized requirements during the COVID-19 emergency crises. The development of a prediction framework can help health authorities to react appropriately and rapidly. Clinical imaging like X-rays and computed tomography (CT) can play a significant part in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients that will help with appropriate treatment. The X-ray images could help in developing an automated system for the rapid identification of COVID-19 patients. This study makes use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract significant features and discriminate X-ray images of infected patients from non-infected ones. Multiple image processing techniques are used to extract a region of interest (ROI) from the entire X-ray image. The ImageDataGenerator class is used to overcome the small dataset size and generate ten thousand augmented images. The performance of the proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art VGG16, AlexNet, and InceptionV3 models. Results demonstrate that the proposed CNN model outperforms other baseline models with high accuracy values: 97.68% for two classes, 89.85% for three classes, and 84.76% for four classes. This system allows COVID-19 patients to be processed by an automated screening system with minimal human contact.},

   abstract = {Increasing resource efficiency and reducing the energy consumption of cloud data centers is critical, especially during the global CORONA virus pandemic. Virtual machines' consolidation using live migration maximizes the hosts' and the reduction of energy consumption. An increase in the host's virtual machines in the consolidation process and the dynamic workload of the virtual machines may cause the overloading in the hosts. One approach to overcome this problem is reducing the hosts' virtual machines. One crucial issue to improve the quality of the consolidation process's quality is determining the best virtual machine for the migration process. Although the selection process has lower computational complexity than other challenges (like placement and overload prediction) in the consolidation process, this issue has received less attention. This article aims to present an efficient algorithm for the selection process. We first considered five main criteria for the selection process: migration time, migration risk, virtual machine connectivity, releasable resources, and penalty for SLA violation. Then, we propose an algorithm based on analytic hierarchy process multi-criteria decision-making technique. Next, to determine the weight of the proposed criteria, we simulate thousands of virtual machines of the PlanetLab workloads. These weights are tunable based on the data center preferences. The results of the suggested approach results show 23% reduction in the hosts' energy consumption, 49% reduction in the number of migrations, and 18% reduction in the SLA violation compared with other techniques. So, using the proposed method may significantly reduce the overall cost of the data centers.},

With such increased interaction because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more online tools have been widely used to provide evidence-based mental health services. This increase helps cover more population by using fewer resources for mental health treatments. Adaptivity and customization for the remedy routine can help solve mental health issues quickly. In this research, we propose a fuzzy contrast-based model that uses an attention network for positional weighted words and classifies mental patient authored text into distinct symptoms. After that, the trained embedding is used to label mental data. Then the attention network expands its lexicons to adapt to the usage of transfer learning techniques. The proposed model uses similarity and contrast sets to classify the weighted attention words. The fuzzy model then uses the sets to classify the mental health data into distinct classes. Our method is compared with non-embedding and traditional techniques to demonstrate the proposed model. From the experiments, the feature vector can achieve a high ROC curve of 0.82 with problems associated with nine symptoms.},

It is more commonly known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); the pandemic threat continues to spread aroundthe world with the fluctuating emergence of its new variants. The severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to serious acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has led to a high human mortality rate and disruption of socioeconomic well-being. For the restoration of pre-pandemic normalcy, the international scientific community has been conducting research on a war footing to limit extremely pathogenic COVID-19 through diagnosis, treatment, and immunization. Since the first report of COVID-19 viral infection, an array of laboratory-based and point-of-care (POC) approaches have emerged for diagnosing and understanding its status of outbreak. The RT-PCR-based viral nucleic acid test (NAT) is one of the rapidly developed and most used COVID-19 detection approaches. Notably, the current forbidding status of COVID-19 requires the development of safe, targeted vaccines/vaccine injections (shots) that can reduce its associated morbidity and mortality. Massive and accelerated vaccination campaigns would be the most effective and ultimate hope to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak, emerging biotechnologies and their multidisciplinary approaches have accelerated the understanding of molecular details as well as the development of a wide range of diagnostics and potential vaccine candidates, which are indispensable to combating the highly contagious COVID-19. Several vaccine candidates have completed phase III clinical studies and are reported to be effective in immunizing against COVID-19 after their rollout via emergency use authorization (EUA). However, optimizing the type of vaccine candidates and its route of delivery that works best to control viral spread is crucial to face the threatening variants expected to emerge over time. In conclusion, the insights of this review would facilitate the development of more likely diagnostics and ideal vaccines for the global control of COVID-19.},

However, as more stakeholders enter these markets, criminals are exploiting their inadvertent security deficiencies to launder illicit funds or finance terrorism. This three-round policy Delphi study involved consultations with 52 experts from different industries and countries to understand future risk-prone technological developments, possible prevention measures and relevant stakeholders. Results highlight a range of money laundering and terrorist financing risks being enabled by advances in distributed ledger technologies (predominantly through cryptocurrencies), new payment methods and financial technology (FinTech). These threats include privacy-enhanced cryptoassets, transaction laundering, e-currencies and digital-only financial services. Findings also suggest that detection-based countermeasures (currently the primary preventative approach) can be coupled with more diverse countermeasures to increase effectiveness. However, the unique circumstances and constraints specific to different stakeholders will affect the nature, utility, and extent to which they can implement certain countermeasures. As such, a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevention is undesirable. Drawing on expert insight from the study, we propose a framework and a 3-point standard of implementation to motivate cost-effective, user-friendly, and innovation-friendly measures to improve suspicious activity detection and futureproof technologies before their criminal exploitation becomes mainstream.},

Several works done for covid-19 detection using different techniques however, the use of small datasets and the lack of validation tests still limit their works. Also, they depend only on the increasing the accuracy and the precision of the model without giving attention to their complexity which is one of the main conditions in the healthcare application. Moreover, the majority of healthcare applications with cloud computing use centralization transmission process of various and vast volumes of information what make the privacy and security of personal patient's data easy for hacking. Furthermore, the traditional architecture of the cloud showed many weaknesses such as the latency and the low persistent performance. Method proposed by the author with technical information: In our system, we used Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and different energy tracking methods such as Teager Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO), Shannon Wavelet Entropy Energy (SWEE), Log Energy Entropy (LEE) for preprocessing the dataset. For the first step, DWT used to decompose the image into coefficients where each coefficient is vector of features. Then, we apply PCA for reduction the dimension by choosing the most essential features in features map. Moreover, we used TKEO, SHEE, LEE to track the energy in the features in order to select the best and the most optimal features to reduce the complexity of the model. Also, we used CNN model that contains convolution and pooling layers due to its efficacity in image processing. Furthermore, we depend on deep neurons using small kernel windows which provide better features learning and minimize the model's complexity. The used DWT-PCA technique with TKEO filtering technique showed great results in terms of noise measure where the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) was 3.14 dB and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of original and preprocessed image was 1.48, 1.47 respectively which guaranteed the performance of the filtering techniques. The experimental results of the CNN model ensure the high performance of the proposed system in classifying the covid-19, pneumonia and normal cases with 97% of accuracy, 100% of precession, 97% of recall, 99% of F1-score, and 98% of AUC. Advantages and application of proposed method: The use of DWT-PCA and TKEO optimize the selection of the optimal features and reduce the complexity of the model. The proposed system achieves good results in identifying covid-19, pneumonia and normal cases. The implementation of fog computing as an intermediate layer to solve the latency problem and computational cost which improve the Quality of Service (QoS) of the cloud. Fog computing ensure the privacy and security of the patients’ data. With further refinement and validation, the IFC-Covid system will be real-time and effective application for covid-19 detection, which is user friendly and costless.},

These studies focused more on sentiment analysis of Twitter tweets in the English language and did not pay more attention to other languages such as Arabic.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the landscape of response to OHCAs, particularly with regard to providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We aimed to describe, characterize, and address the attitudes and concerns of healthcare workers towards CPR of OHCA patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of healthcare workers and trainees in the United States and Saudi Arabia via an online survey available between October 2020, and May 2021. The primary outcome of interest was willingness to perform CPR for OHCA, with confidence to handle CPR for OHCA as our secondary outcome. Results: A total of 501 healthcare professionals, including 436 (87%) with background in emergency medicine, participated in our survey. 331 (66%) reported being willing to perform CPR for OHCA, while 170 (34%) were not willing. 311 (94%) willing participants stated that their medical oath and moral responsibility were the main motivators for willingness, while a fear of contracting COVID-19 was the primary demotivating factor for 126 (74%) unwilling participants. Time series analysis with simple exponential smoothing showed an increase in willingness to perform CPR from 30% to 50%, as well as an increase in mean confidence level to perform CPR from 60% to 70%, between October 2020 and May 2021. Conclusions: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected healthcare workers' attitudes towards performing CPR for OHCA. Confidence levels and willingness to perform CPR increased over time during the study period. Efforts should be directed towards the creation of standardized and evidence-based guidelines for CPR during COVID-19, as well as increasing knowledge regarding risks of infection and effective use of PPE during resuscitation.},

   abstract = {Telecom operators' infrastructure is sustained by optical communication networks that provide the means for exchanging large amounts of information, which is essential for many modern society needs. Optical networks are characterized by rapid breakthroughs in a variety of technologies. Relevantly, the last decade encompassed remarkable advances in optical networks’ subfields of signal processing, electronics, photonics, communications, protocols, and control-plane architectures. Hence, these advancements unlocked unprecedented transmission capacities, reconfigurability and programmability, entailing an evolution in the way which networks were designed, planned, and analyzed. In this paper, we review the historical status of optical planning and design tools by focusing on the major enabling technologies and relevant landmarks of the last decade(s). We begin by pinpointing the major breakthroughs in the optical data plane, estimation models capturing the transmission medium behavior and the control plane. We then distil the implications that these advancements entail in the landscape of optical network design and analysis tools, which commonly sit “on top” of the control plane or as a fully separated entity. Then, we speculate with our view for the future, in which automatic validation of optical network operations and dimensioning jointly with learning/artificial intelligence mechanisms will permit zero-touch optical networking: i.e. updating, provisioning, and upgrading network capacities, by means of automation with minimal human intervention. We conclude with a proposal of an architecture that encompasses data and control planes in a comprehensive manner for paving the way towards zero-touch optical networking.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 virus has spread rapidally throughout the world. Managing resources is one of the biggest challenges that healthcare providers around the world face during the pandemic. Allocating the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds' capacity is important since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and some patients need to be admitted to the hospital with an urgent need for oxygen support, ventilation, and/or intensive medical care. In the battle against COVID-19, many governments utilized technology, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), to contain the pandemic and limit its hazardous effects. In this paper, Machine Learning models (ML) were developed to help in detecting the COVID-19 patients’ need for the ICU and the estimated duration of their stay. Four ML algorithms were utilized: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Ensemble models were trained and validated on a dataset of 895 COVID-19 patients admitted to King Fahad University hospital in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The conducted experiments show that the Length of Stay (LoS) in the ICU can be predicted with the highest accuracy by applying the RF model for prediction, as the achieved accuracy was 94.16%. In terms of the contributor factors to the length of stay in the ICU, correlation results showed that age, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), nasal oxygen support days are the top related factors. By searching the literature, there is no published work that used the Saudi Arabia dataset to predict the need for ICU with the number of days needed. This contribution is hoped to pave the path for hospitals and healthcare providers to manage their resources more efficiently and to help in saving lives.},

The proposed conceptual framework specifies different levels of anthropomorphism of AI agents and, drawing on insights from psychology, marketing and human–computer interaction literature, establishes a conceptual link between AI anthropomorphism and self-congruence. The paper then explains how this can lead to self–AI integration, a novel concept that articulates the process of users integrating AI agents into their self-concept. However, these effects can depend on a range of moderating factors, such as consumer traits, situational factors, self-construal and social exclusion. Crucially, the conceptual framework specifies how these processes can lead to specific personal-, group- and societal-level consequences, such as emotional connection and digital dementia. The research agenda proposed on the basis of the conceptual framework identifies key areas of interest that should be tackled by future research concerning this important phenomenon.},

This study focused on the perceptions, predictions, and suggestions of female breadwinner parents from low-income families regarding their children’s distance learning. Data were collected from 12 mothers who participated in a three-stage focus group study. The data from the focus group discussions were thematically analyzed into three categories: (1) financial issues, (2) social and cultural issues, and (3) educational issues. Additionally, the findings presented the breadwinners’ general and technological reasons for their predictions for enhancing education in the future if schools return to face-to-face learning or pursue a blended learning approach. The breadwinners suggested three approaches to teaching and learning for the following academic year. The findings of this study may be useful in the development of educational policies and training programs to provide essential social and technological support to low-income families to address their needs in the online learning environment and to improve digital equity for low-income families who are likely to be educationally disadvantaged.},

After the initiation of vaccinations against coronavirus, people's feelings have become more diverse and complex. Our aim is to understand and unravel their sentiments in this research using deep learning techniques. Social media is currently the best way to express feelings and emotions, and with the help of Twitter, one can have a better idea of what is trending and going on in people's minds. Our motivation for this research was to understand the diverse sentiments of people regarding the vaccination process. In this research, the timeline of the collected tweets was from December 21 to July21. The tweets contained information about the most common vaccines available recently from across the world. The sentiments of people regarding vaccines of all sorts were assessed using the natural language processing (NLP) tool, Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoner (VADER). Initializing the polarities of the obtained sentiments into three groups (positive, negative, and neutral) helped us visualize the overall scenario; our findings included 33.96% positive, 17.55% negative, and 48.49% neutral responses. In addition, we included our analysis of the timeline of the tweets in this research, as sentiments fluctuated over time. A recurrent neural network- (RNN-) oriented architecture, including long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), was used to assess the performance of the predictive models, with LSTM achieving an accuracy of 90.59% and Bi-LSTM achieving 90.83%. Other performance metrics such as precision, F1-score, and a confusion matrix were also used to validate our models and findings more effectively. This study improves understanding of the public's opinion on COVID-19 vaccines and supports the aim of eradicating coronavirus from the world.},

   abstract = {Aerial surveillance using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides an on-demand and cost-effective solution to smart-city monitoring needs, owing to their three-dimensional positioning adjustment and autonomy. The optimal deployment of a UAV swarm, also known as a flying ad hoc network (FANET), to achieve on-demand coverage of mobile ground targets (MGTs) is challenging in terms of controlling UAV mobility to maximize coverage while maintaining quality of service. Data routing from UAVs to a base station (BS) without awareness of the updated topology causes link breakages, excessive retransmissions, high congestion, and energy holes. Therefore, we propose a joint topology control and routing (JTCR) protocol comprising three modules to perform crowd surveillance. The first JTCR module provides virtual force-based mobility control (VFMC), which controls the mobility of UAVs to track MGTs, ensuring stable bi-connectivity. The second module provides energy- efficient mobility-aware fuzzy clustering that clusters the FANET to aggregate the sensed data to each cluster head (CH) by utilizing the UAV mobility provided by the VFMC. The third module provides topology-aware Q- routing, which routes the aggregated data from CH UAVs to the BS by selecting an optimal path in terms of delay, path stability, and energy consumption. According to our performance study, the proposed JTCR outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of tracking-coverage rate, connectivity rate, the number of retransmissions, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption. This is mainly enabled by the realistic mobility control of the UAV swarm at the reasonable cost of control overhead.},

This requires measuring biomarkers and pathogens rapidly at the different points where sepsis care is provided. Current commercial approaches for sepsis diagnosis are not fast, sensitive, and/or specific enough for meeting this medical challenge. In this article, we review recent advances in the development of diagnostic tools for sepsis management based on micro- and nanostructured materials. We start with a brief introduction to the most popular biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis (lactate, procalcitonin, cytokines, C-reactive protein, and other emerging protein and non-protein biomarkers including miRNAs and cell-based assays) and methods for detecting bacteremia. We then highlight the role of nano- and microstructured materials in developing biosensors for detecting them taking into consideration the particular needs of every point of sepsis care (e.g., ultrafast detection of multiple protein biomarkers for diagnosing in triage, emergency room, ward, and intensive care unit; quantitative detection to de-escalate treatment; ultrasensitive and culture-independent detection of blood pathogens for personalized antimicrobial therapies; robust, portable, and web-connected biomarker tests outside the hospital). We conclude with an overview of the most utilized nano- and microstructured materials used thus far for solving issues related to sepsis diagnosis and point to new challenges for future development.

Because of the current living situation, clinical pathogens are difficult to identify. Therefore, biosensors have been widely utilized to sense the biomolecules relevant to viruses and bacteria. The biosensors observe the nanoparticles from the pathogens and help improve the infection analysis. The sensor information is processed using machine learning techniques because it consists of several learning patterns. However, the existing methods have multi-objective optimization problems while analysing the changes in the nanoparticles. This work utilizes a mayfly optimized convoluted neural network (MOCNN) to overcome this research issue. The grid uses the fully convolution layer that processes the extracted biosensor features to determine the infections. The network performance is optimized by applying the exploitation and exploration properties of nuptial dance that help to escape from the local optima solutions. The effective utilization of the optimized training patterns improves the convergence speed and convergence rate compared to traditional methods. From the results, MOCNN ensures 98.97% accuracy, 0.388 error rate, and 0.322833 convergence rate on various iterations with different learning rates.},

Transferability enables reuse of already-learned knowledge for continued learning, reduce training time, resource consumption, training labels and improve prediction accuracy.

Predicting students’ performance in hybrid environments is a complex task because it depends on extracting and analyzing different types of data: log data, self-reports, and face-to-face interactions. Students must develop Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) strategies to monitor their learning in hybrid contexts. This study aimed to predict the achievement of 82 undergraduates enrolled in a hybrid English for Business Communication course using data mining techniques. While clustering techniques were used to understand SRL patterns through classifying students with similar SRL data into clusters, classification algorithms were utilized to predict students' achievement by integrating the log files and course engagement factors. Clustering results showed that the group with high SRL achieved higher grades than the groups with medium SRL and low SRL. Classification results revealed that log data and engagement activities successfully predicted students’ academic performance with more than 88% accuracy. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature of SRL and hybrid classrooms by interpreting the predictive power of log data, self-reports, and face-to-face engagement to predict students’ achievement, a relatively unexplored area.

Occupancy detection and estimation have been recognized as key contributors to improving building energy efficiency. Several solutions have been proposed for the past decade to improve the precision performance of occupancy detection and estimation in the building. Environmental sensing is one of the practical solutions to detect and estimate occupants in the building during uncertain behavior. However, the literature reveals that the performance of environmental sensing is relatively poor due to the poor quality of the training dataset used in the model. This study proposed a smart sensing framework that combined camera-based and environmental sensing approaches using supervised learning to gather standard and robust datasets related to indoor occupancy that can be used for cross-validation of different machine learning algorithms in formal research. The proposed solution is tested in the living room with a prototype system integrated with various sensors using a random forest regressor, although other techniques could be easily integrated within the proposed framework. The primary implication of this study is to predict the room occupation through the use of sensors providing inputs into a model to lower energy consumption. The results indicate that the proposed solution can obtain data, process, and predict occupant presence and number with 99.3% accuracy. Additionally, to demonstrate the impact of occupant number in energy saving, one room with two zones is modeled each zone with air condition with different thermostat controller. The first zone uses IoFClime and the second zone uses modified IoFClime using a design-builder. The simulation is conducted using EnergyPlus software with the random simulation of 10 occupants and local climate data under three scenarios. The Fanger model’s thermal comfort analysis shows that up to 50% and 25% energy can be saved under the first and third scenarios.},

Using drones is seen as a robust approach for mobile remote sensing operations, such as search‐and‐rescue missions, due to their speed and efficiency, which could seriously affect victims’ chances of survival. This paper aims to modify the Hata‐Davidson empirical propagation model based on RF drone measurement to con-duct searches for missing persons in complex environments with rugged areas after manmade or natural disasters. A drone was coupled with a thermal FLIR lepton camera, a microcontroller, GPS, and weather station sensors. The proposed modified model utilized the least squares tuning algorithm to fit the data measured from the drone communication system. This enhanced the RF connectivity between the drone and the local authority, as well as leading to increased coverage foot-print and, thus, the performance of wider search‐and‐rescue operations in a timely fashion using strip search patterns. The development of the proposed model considered both software simulation and hardware implementations. Since empirical propagation models are the most adjustable mod-els, this study concludes with a comparison between the modified Hata‐Davidson algorithm against other well‐known modified empirical models for validation using root mean square error (RMSE). The experimental results show that the modified Hata‐Davidson model outperforms the other empirical models, which in turn helps to identify missing persons and their locations using thermal imaging and a GPS sensor.},

The rapid growth of the infected cases by COVID-19 pandemic makes a lots of anxiety and fear among people. With the recent released of Pfizer vaccine, people start posting a lot of rumors regarding the safety concerns of the vaccine, especially among the elderly people. The aim of this study is to bring out the fact that tweets containing all pertinent details about the COVID-19 vaccine and provides an analysis and understanding of users emotions regarding the recent release of COVID-19 vaccine. This study starts with the collection of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccine and then cleaning the dataset from redundant tweets. In this study, we use Twitter API and Web Scraping techniques to obtain a sample of 50,000 tweets talking about COVID-19 vaccine.Further, The analysis of users emotions is achieved by manually labeling and classifying the tweets to either positive or negative. Then, a deep learning based model is used to train the data and classify the people opinion about COVID-19 vaccine. The experimental results illustrate that high percentage of people have shown a positive attitude towards COVID1-19 vaccine. The proposed method is validated over Twitter datasets and the results also demonstrate that use of deep learning classifier can successfully improve the accuracy of people emotions analysis with an accuracy up to 98% for training set and the accuracy for testing set is 73%.},

   abstract = {The massive availability of cameras and personal devices results in a wide variability between imaging conditions, producing large intra-class variations and a significant performance drop if images from heterogeneous environments are compared for person recognition purposes. However, as biometric solutions are extensively deployed, it will be common to replace acquisition hardware as it is damaged or newer designs appear or to exchange information between agencies or applications operating in different environments. Furthermore, variations in imaging spectral bands can also occur. For example, face images are typically acquired in the visible (VIS) spectrum, while iris images are usually captured in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. However, cross-spectrum comparison may be needed if, for example, a face image obtained from a surveillance camera needs to be compared against a legacy database of iris imagery. Here, we propose a multialgorithmic approach to cope with periocular images captured with different sensors. With face masks in the front line to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, periocular recognition is regaining popularity since it is the only region of the face that remains visible. As a solution to the mentioned cross-sensor issues, we integrate different biometric comparators using a score fusion scheme based on linear logistic regression This approach is trained to improve the discriminating ability and, at the same time, to encourage that fused scores are represented by log-likelihood ratios. This allows easy interpretation of output scores and the use of Bayes thresholds for optimal decision-making since scores from different comparators are in the same probabilistic range. We evaluate our approach in the context of the 1st Cross-Spectral Iris/Periocular Competition, whose aim was to compare person recognition approaches when periocular data from visible and near-infrared images is matched. The proposed fusion approach achieves reductions in the error rates of up to 30%–40% in cross-spectral NIR–VIS comparisons with respect to the best individual system, leading to an EER of 0.2% and a FRR of just 0.47% at FAR = 0.01%. It also represents the best overall approach of the mentioned competition. Experiments are also reported with a database of VIS images from two different smartphones as well, achieving even bigger relative improvements and similar performance numbers. We also discuss the proposed approach from the point of view of template size and computation times, with the most computationally heavy comparator playing an important role in the results. Lastly, the proposed method is shown to outperform other popular fusion approaches in multibiometrics, such as the average of scores, Support Vector Machines, or Random Forest.},

The IoT and AI enabled smart systems can play a key role in driving the future of smart healthcare. Remote monitoring of critical and non-critical patients is one such field which can leverage the benefits of IoT and machine learning techniques. While some work has been done in developing paradigms to establish effective and reliable communications, there is still great potential to utilize optimized IoT network and machine learning technique to improve the overall performance of the communication systems, thus enabling fool-proof systems. This study develops a novel IoT framework to offer ultra-reliable low latency communications to monitor post-surgery patients. The work considers both critical and non-critical patients and is balanced between these to offer optimal performance for the desired outcomes. In addition, machine learning based regression analysis of patients’ sensory data is performed to obtain highly accurate predictions of the patients’ sensory data (patients’ vitals), which enables highly accurate virtual observers to predict the data in case of communication failures. The performance analysis of the proposed IoT based vital signs monitoring system for the post-surgery patients offers reduced delay and packet loss in comparison to IEEE low latency deterministic networks. The gradient boosting regression analysis also gives a highly accurate prediction for slow as well as rapidly varying sensors for vital sign monitoring.},

Additional challenges loom for the next phase. These include optimizing the immunological rationale for boosting—how often and with what—and the best approaches for building a future-proofed, durable immune repertoire to protect against oncoming viral variants, including in children. The landscape of vaccine producers and technologies is likely to become even more heterogeneous. There is a need now for appraisal of future approaches: While some favor frequent boosting with the first-generation, ancestral spike vaccines, others propose frequent readjustment using current variant sequences, polyvalent vaccines, or pan-coronavirus strategies.

   abstract = {The importance of medical data and the crucial nature of the decisions that are based on such data, as well as the large increase in its volume, has encouraged researchers to develop feature selection (FS)-based approaches to identify the most relevant data for specific medical problems In this paper, two intelligent wrapper FS approaches based on a new metaheuristic algorithm named the coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (CHIO) were applied with and without the incorporation of a greedy crossover (GC) operator strategy to enhance exploration of the search space by CHIO. The two proposed approaches, CHIO and CHIO-GC, were evaluated using 23 medical benchmark datasets and a real-world COVID-19 dataset. The experimental results indicated that CHIO-GC outperformed CHIO in terms of search capability, as reflected in classification accuracy, selection size, F-measure, standard deviation and convergence speed. The GC operator was able to enhance the balance between exploration and exploitation of the CHIO in the search and correct suboptimal solutions for faster convergence. The proposed CHIO-GC was also compared with two previous wrapper FS approaches, namely, binary moth flame optimization with Lévy flight (LBMFO_V3) and the hyper learning binary dragonfly algorithm (HLBDA), as well as four filter methods namely, Chi-square, Relief, correlation-based feature selection and information gain. CHIO-GC surpassed LBMFO_V3 and the four filter methods with an accuracy rate of 0.79 on 23 medical benchmark datasets. CHIO-GC also surpassed HLBDA with an accuracy rate of 0.93 when applied to the COVID-19 dataset. These encouraging results were obtained by striking a sufficient balance between the two search phases of CHIO-GC during the hunt for correct solutions, which also increased the convergence rate. This was accomplished by integrating a greedy crossover technique into the CHIO algorithm to remedy the inferior solutions found during premature convergence and while locked into a local optimum search space.},

Hence, there is a need to propose a model to predict the COVID-19 cases at the earliest possible to control the disease spread. In order to assist the medical professionals and reduce workload and the time the COVID-19 diagnosis cycle takes, this paper proposes a novel neural network architecture termed as O-Net to automatically segment chest Computerised Tomography Ct-scans infected by COVID-19 with optimised computing power and memory occupation. The O-Net consists of two convolutional autoencoders with an upsampling channel and a downsampling channel. Experimental tests show our proposal's effectiveness and potential, with a dice score of 0.86, pixel accuracy, precision, specificity of 0.99, 0.99, 0.98, respectively. Performance on the external dataset illustrates generalisation and scalability capabilities of the O-Net model to Ct-scan obtained from different scanners with different sizes. The second objective of this work is to introduce our virtual reality platform, COVIR, that visualises and manipulates 3D reconstructed lungs and segmented infected lesions caused by COVID-19. COVIR platform acts as a reading and visualisation support for medical practitioners to diagnose COVID-19 lung infection. The COVIR platform could be used for medical education professional practice and training. It was tested by Thirteen participants (medical staff, researchers, and collaborators), they conclude that the 3D VR visualisation of segmented Ct-Scan provides an aid diagnosis tool for better interpretation.},

   abstract = {During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (also known as COVID-19), workforce downsizing needs, safety requirements, supply chain breaks and inventory shortages affected manufacturing systems’ and supply chain's responsiveness and resilience. Companies wandered in a disrupted scenario because recommended actions/strategies to survive – and thrive – were not available an improvised actions to keep their operations up and running. This paper analyzes the COVID-19 impacts on the workforce and supply resilience in a holistic manner. The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.},

Other people have also used this platform to post their concerns about the spread of this virus and a rapid increase of death cases globally. The aim of this work is to detect anomalous events associated with COVID-19 from Twitter. To this end, we propose a distributed Directed Acyclic Graph topology framework to aggregate and process large-scale real-time tweets related to COVID-19. The core of our system is a novel lightweight algorithm that can automatically detect anomaly events. In addition, our system can also identify, cluster, and visualize important keywords in tweets. On 18 August 2020, our model detected the highest anomaly since many tweets mentioned the casualties’ updates and the debates on the pandemic that day. We obtained the three most commonly listed terms on Twitter: “covid”, “death”, and “Trump” (21,566, 11,779, and 4761 occurrences, respectively), with the highest TF-IDF score for these terms: “people” (0.63637), “school” (0.5921407) and “virus” (0.57385). From our clustering result, the word “death”, “corona”, and “case” are grouped into one cluster, where the word “pandemic”, “school”, and “president” are grouped as another cluster. These terms were located near each other on vector space so that they were clustered, indicating people's most concerned topics on Twitter.},

They estimate their model using a novel data set capturing the continuous development of a network and users' entire action histories within the network. The results reveal that similarity (homophily) with a potential friend, the properties of a potential friend's network, and her domain expertise all play a role in friendship formation. Via prediction exercises, the authors find that stimulating anime watching is the most effective site-wide intervention which leads to the highest overall site traffic and the largest number of active users and that recommending a friend of a friend as a potential friend is the most effective strategy in stimulating friendship tie formation. In contrast to the common finding for static networks, the results indicate that seeding to users with the most friends is not the most effective strategy to increase users' activity levels in an evolving network.},

In this context, through a micro-level analysis, this article investigates the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects the economically bottom-class citizens and their businesses, focusing on small-scale vendors in Ghana. It utilises content analysis to examine 384 small-scale vendors in four cities/towns (Accra, Tema, Sunyani, Ho) in Ghana between August and October 2021. We show that the pandemic has negatively affected economic life and ordinary living conditions by increasing poverty among economically bottom-class citizens, likely to have dire long-term consequences nationally. Further, we contend that the small-scale vendors and entrepreneurs recognise leveraging the increasing Chinese global economic influence. Thus, China provides an exit point through which the people can navigate themselves out of the COVID-19 predicaments. Our study is novel for its first-level—individual—analysis of the impact of COVID-19 in the Ghanaian market space from an IR perspective. It also provides policy relevance.</p>},

Early detection of COVID-19 may significantly increase the rate of survival; thus, it is critical that the disease is detected early. Emerging technologies have been used to prevent, diagnose, and manage COVID-19 among the populace in the USA and globally. Numerous studies have revealed the growing implementation of novel engineered systems during the intervention at various points of the disease’s pathogenesis, especially as it relates to comorbidities and complications related to cardiovascular and respiratory organ systems. In this review, we provide a succinct, but extensive, review of the pathogenesis of COVID-19, particularly as it relates to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a viral entry point. This is followed by a comprehensive analysis of cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities of COVID-19 and novel technologies that are used to diagnose and manage hospitalized patients. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring systems, novel machine learning algorithms for rapidly triaging patients, various imaging modalities, wearable immunosensors, hotspot tracking systems, and other emerging technologies are reviewed. COVID-19 effects on the immune system, associated inflammatory biomarkers, and innovative therapies are also assessed. Finally, with emphasis on the impact of wearable and non-wearable systems, this review highlights future technologies that could help diagnose, monitor, and mitigate disease progression. Technologies that account for an individual’s health conditions, comorbidities, and even socioeconomic factors can drastically reduce the high mortality seen among many COVID-19 patients, primarily via disease prevention, early detection, and pertinent management.},

To exploit the full potential of cross-institutional clinical big data, machine learning systems must gain the ability to transfer their knowledge across institutional boundaries and learn from new episodes of patient care without forgetting previously learned patterns. In this work, we developed a privacy-preserving learning algorithm named WUPERR (Weight Uncertainty Propagation and Episodic Representation Replay) and validated the algorithm in the context of early prediction of sepsis using data from over 104,000 patients across four distinct healthcare systems. We tested the hypothesis, that the proposed continual learning algorithm can maintain higher predictive performance than competing methods on previous cohorts once it has been trained on a new patient cohort. In the sepsis prediction task, after incremental training of a deep learning model across four hospital systems (namely hospitals H-A, H-B, H-C, and H-D), WUPERR maintained the highest positive predictive value across the first three hospitals compared to a baseline transfer learning approach (H-A: 39.27% vs. 31.27% , H-B: 25.34% vs. 22.34% , H-C: 30.33 % vs. 28.33% ).

This prevention-centered strategy seeks a balance between geographical coverage and social group fairness.

   abstract = {Background: Public engagement is a key element for mitigating pandemics, and a good understanding of public opinion could help to encourage the successful adoption of public health measures by the population. In past years, deep learning has been increasingly applied to the analysis of text from social networks. However, most of the developed approaches can only capture topics or sentiments alone but not both together. Objective: Here, we aimed to develop a new approach, based on deep neural networks, for simultaneously capturing public topics and sentiments and applied it to tweets sent just after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods: A total of 1,386,496 tweets were collected, preprocessed, and split with a ratio of 80:20 into training and validation sets, respectively. We combined lexicons and convolutional neural networks to improve sentiment prediction. The trained model achieved an overall accuracy of 81% and a precision of 82% and was able to capture simultaneously the weighted words associated with a predicted sentiment intensity score. These outputs were then visualized via an interactive and customizable web interface based on a word cloud representation. Using word cloud analysis, we captured the main topics for extreme positive and negative sentiment intensity scores. Results: In reaction to the announcement of the pandemic by the WHO, 6 negative and 5 positive topics were discussed on Twitter. Twitter users seemed to be worried about the international situation, economic consequences, and medical situation. Conversely, they seemed to be satisfied with the commitment of medical and social workers and with the collaboration between people. Conclusions: We propose a new method based on deep neural networks for simultaneously extracting public topics and sentiments from tweets. This method could be helpful for monitoring public opinion during crises such as pandemics.},

   abstract = {Background: Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is neither always accessible nor easy to perform in children. We aimed to propose a machine learning model to assess the need for a SARS-CoV-2 test in children (<16 years old), depending on their clinical symptoms. Methods: Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained from the REDCap® registry. Overall, 4434 SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed in symptomatic children between 1 November 2020 and 31 March 2021, 784 were positive (17.68%). We pre-processed the data to be suitable for a machine learning (ML) algorithm, balancing the positive-negative rate and preparing subsets of data by age. We trained several models and chose those with the best performance for each subset. Results: The use of ML demonstrated an AUROC of 0.65 to predict a COVID-19 diagnosis in children. The absence of high-grade fever was the major predictor of COVID-19 in younger children, whereas loss of taste or smell was the most determinant symptom in older children. Conclusions: Although the accuracy of the models was lower than expected, they can be used to provide a diagnosis when epidemiological data on the risk of exposure to COVID-19 is unknown.},

   abstract = {The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global public health. Drug repurposing is a time-efficient approach to finding effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in this emergency. Here, we present a robust experimental design combining deep learning with molecular docking experiments to identify the most promising candidates from the list of FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19. We have employed a deep learning-based Drug Target Interaction (DTI) model, called DeepDTA, with few improvements to predict drug-protein binding affinities, represented as KIBA scores, for 2440 FDA-approved and 8168 investigational drugs against 24 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. FDA-approved drugs with the highest KIBA scores were selected for molecular docking simulations. We ran around 50,000 docking simulations for 168 selected drugs against 285 total predicted and/or experimentally proven active sites of all 24 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A list of 49 most promising FDA-approved drugs with the best consensus KIBA scores and binding affinity values against selected SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins was generated. Most importantly, 16 drugs including anidulafungin, velpatasvir, glecaprevir, rifapentine, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), terlipressin, and selinexor demonstrated the highest predicted inhibitory potential against key SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. We further measured the inhibitory activity of 5 compounds (rifapentine, velpatasvir, glecaprevir, anidulafungin, and FAD disodium) on SARS-CoV-2 PLpro using Ubiquitin-Rhodamine 110 Gly fluorescent intensity assay. The highest inhibition of PLpro activity was seen with rifapentine (IC50: 15.18 μM) and FAD disodium (IC50: 12.39 μM), the drugs with high predicted KIBA scores and binding affinities.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology that empowers virtually any electricity consumer paying for peak demand charges to proactively execute demand response actions even without receiving signals or information coming from the utility, and only when necessary to effectively reduce demand charges and user inconvenience. The proposed methodology employs different arithmetic models and tree-based machine learning models to determine an efficient electricity demand threshold value before the start of a billing period. This methodology is completely model agnostic so additional models can be integrated without changing the proposed process. The threshold value produced can be used to proactively trigger peak demand shaving and other demand response actions in order to reduce demand charges. The results obtained using real data showed that regression random decision forest based models outperformed different arithmetic models and other tree-based machine learning models at determining this threshold value for an industrial, an educational with solar photovoltaic electricity generation, and a residential consumer. The results also showed that the consumers evaluated could potentially achieve between 63% to 75% of total potential demand charge reductions during a year. These results translate to US$ 159.00, US$ 23,290.00, and US$ 107,389.00 in savings for the residential, industrial, and educational consumer respectively.},

References to so-called recurring waves of infections remain pervasive among news headlines, political messaging, and public health sources. We explore the power of analogies to facilitate understanding of biological models and processes by reviewing strengths and limitations of analogies used throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider how, when analogies fall short, their ability to persuade can mislead public perception, even if unintentionally. Although waves can convey patterns of disease outbreak, we suggest process-based analogies might be more effective communication tools, given that they can be easily mapped to underlying epidemiological concepts and extended to include complex dynamics. Although no single analogy perfectly captures disease dynamics, fire is particularly suitable for visualizing epidemiological models, underscoring the importance and reasoning behind control strategies and potentially conveying a sense of urgency that can galvanize individual and collective action.

   abstract = {Purpose: Deploying external artificial intelligence (AI) models locally can be logistically challenging. We aimed to use the ACR AI-LAB software platform for local testing of a chest radiograph (CXR) algorithm for COVID-19 lung disease severity assessment. Methods: An externally developed deep learning model for COVID-19 radiographic lung disease severity assessment was loaded into the AI-LAB platform at an independent academic medical center, which was separate from the institution in which the model was trained. The data set consisted of CXR images from 141 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction–confirmed COVID-19, which were routed to AI-LAB for model inference. The model calculated a Pulmonary X-ray Severity (PXS) score for each image. This score was correlated with the average of a radiologist-based assessment of severity, the modified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema score, independently interpreted by three radiologists. The associations between the PXS score and patient admission and intubation or death were assessed. Results: The PXS score deployed in AI-LAB correlated with the radiologist-determined modified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema score (r = 0.80). PXS score was significantly higher in patients who were admitted (4.0 versus 1.3, P < .001) or intubated or died within 3 days (5.5 versus 3.3, P = .001). Conclusions: AI-LAB was successfully used to test an external COVID-19 CXR AI algorithm on local data with relative ease, showing generalizability of the PXS score model. For AI models to scale and be clinically useful, software tools that facilitate the local testing process, like the freely available AI-LAB, will be important to cross the AI implementation gap in health care systems.},

However, AI could also have negative effects on the development of professional expertise. Solution: A review of the literature on expertise development is provided, followed by examples of AI implementation in a knowledge-intensive profession, accounting. The analysis of these examples suggests that automation can result in the loss of expertise due to reduced opportunities for learning from deliberate practice and experienced colleagues, and from working on progressively more complex tasks. Implications for human resource development (HRD) include creating alternative individual development opportunities and promoting organizational cultures conducive to expertise development in human-machine interaction modes.

Practical implications will be of relevance to HRD professionals and managers responsible for the implementation of artificial intelligence solutions.},

   abstract = {Background: Patients hospitalized for a given condition may be receiving other treatments for other contemporary conditions or comorbidities. The use of such observational clinical data for pharmacological hypothesis generation is appealing in the context of an emerging disease but particularly challenging due to the presence of drug indication bias. Objective: With this study, our main objective was the development and validation of a fully data-driven pipeline that would address this challenge. Our secondary objective was to generate pharmacological hypotheses in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrate the clinical relevance of the pipeline. Methods: We developed a pharmacopeia-wide association study (PharmWAS) pipeline inspired from the PheWAS methodology, which systematically screens for associations between the whole pharmacopeia and a clinical phenotype. First, a fully data-driven procedure based on adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) determined drug-specific adjustment sets. Second, we computed several measures of association, including robust methods based on propensity scores (PSs) to control indication bias. Finally, we applied the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure of the false discovery rate (FDR). We applied this method in a multicenter retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from 16 university hospitals of the Greater Paris area. We included all adult patients between 18 and 95 years old hospitalized in conventional wards for COVID-19 between February 1, 2020, and June 15, 2021. We investigated the association between drug prescription within 48 hours from admission and 28-day mortality. We validated our data-driven pipeline against a knowledge-based pipeline on 3 treatments of reference, for which experts agreed on the expected association with mortality. We then demonstrated its clinical relevance by screening all drugs prescribed in more than 100 patients to generate pharmacological hypotheses. Results: A total of 5783 patients were included in the analysis. The median age at admission was 69.2 (IQR 56.7-81.1) years, and 3390 (58.62%) of the patients were male. The performance of our automated pipeline was comparable or better for controlling bias than the knowledge-based adjustment set for 3 reference drugs: dexamethasone, phloroglucinol, and paracetamol. After correction for multiple testing, 4 drugs were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Among these, diazepam and tramadol were the only ones not discarded by automated diagnostics, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.51 (95% CI 1.52-4.16, Q=.01) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.32-2.85, Q=.02), respectively. Conclusions: Our innovative approach proved useful in generating pharmacological hypotheses in an outbreak setting, without requiring a priori knowledge of the disease. Our systematic analysis of early prescribed treatments from patients hospitalized for COVID-19 showed that diazepam and tramadol are associated with increased 28-day mortality. Whether these drugs could worsen COVID-19 needs to be further assessed.},

   abstract = {Online social networks serve as a convenient way to connect, share, and promote content with others. As a result, these networks can be used with malicious intent, causing disruption and harm to public debate through the sharing of misinformation. However, automatically identifying such content through its use of natural language is a significant challenge compared to our solution which uses less computational resources, language-agnostic and without the need for complex semantic analysis. Consequently alternative and complementary approaches are highly valuable. In this paper, we assess content that has the potential for misinformation and focus on patterns of user association with online social media communities (subreddits) in the popular Reddit social media platform, and generate networks of behaviour capturing user interaction with different subreddits. We examine these networks using both global and local metrics, in particular noting the presence of induced substructures (graphlets) assessing 7,876,064 posts from 96,634 users. From subreddits identified as having potential for misinformation, we note that the associated networks have strongly defined local features relating to node degree — these are evident both from analysis of dominant graphlets and degree-related global metrics. We find that these local features support high accuracy classification of subreddits that are categorised as having the potential for misinformation. Consequently we observe that induced local substructures of high degree are fundamental metrics for subreddit classification, and support automatic detection capabilities for online misinformation independent from any particular language.},

Currently, the methods used to diagnose COVID-19 have several limitations, thus new techniques need to be investigated to improve the diagnosis and overcome these limitations. Taking into consideration the great benefits of electrocardiogram (ECG) applications, this paper proposes a new pipeline called ECG-BiCoNet to investigate the potential of using ECG data for diagnosing COVID-19. ECG-BiCoNet employs five deep learning models of distinct structural design. ECG-BiCoNet extracts two levels of features from two different layers of each deep learning technique. Features mined from higher layers are fused using discrete wavelet transform and then integrated with lower-layers features. Afterward, a feature selection approach is utilized. Finally, an ensemble classification system is built to merge predictions of three machine learning classifiers. ECG-BiCoNet accomplishes two classification categories, binary and multiclass. The results of ECG-BiCoNet present a promising COVID-19 performance with an accuracy of 98.8% and 91.73% for binary and multiclass classification categories. These results verify that ECG data may be used to diagnose COVID-19 which can help clinicians in the automatic diagnosis and overcome limitations of manual diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Many people in the United States have achieved economic stability through self-employment and are often seen as embracing the entrepreneurial spirit and seizing opportunity. Yet, research also suggests that self-employment may be precarious for many people in the lower socioeconomic strata. Drawing on a unique dataset that combines longitudinal survey data with administrative tax data for a sample of low- and moderate-income (LMI) workers, we bring new evidence to bear on this debate by examining the link between self-employment and economic insecurity. Overall, our results show that self-employment is associated with greater economic insecurity among LMI workers compared with wage-and-salary employment. For instance, compared with their wage-and-salary counterparts, the self-employed have 78, 168, and 287 percent greater odds of having an income below basic expenses, and experiencing an unexpected income decline and high levels of income volatility, respectively. We also find that differences in financial endowment and access to health insurance are key drivers in explaining the relationship between employment type and economic insecurity, as being able to access $2,000 in an emergency greatly lowers the odds of budgetary constraint, whereas lack of health insurance increases those odds. These findings suggest that formal work arrangements with wages and benefits offered by an employer promotes greater economic stability among LMI workers compared with informal work arrangements via self-employment. We discuss implications of these results for future research and policy initiatives seeking to promote economic wellbeing through entrepreneurship.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose As “time is brain” in acute stroke triage, the need for automated prognostication tools continues to increase, particularly in rapidly expanding tele-stroke settings. We aimed to create an automated prognostication tool for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke based on admission CTA radiomics. Methods We automatically extracted 1116 radiomics features from the anterior circulation territory on admission CTAs of 829 acute LVO stroke patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy in two academic centers. We trained, optimized, validated, and compared different machine-learning models to predict favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2) at discharge and 3-month follow-up using four different input sets: “Radiomics”, “Radiomics + Treatment” (radiomics, post-thrombectomy reperfusion grade, and intravenous thrombolysis), “Clinical + Treatment” (baseline clinical variables and treatment), and “Combined” (radiomics, treatment, and baseline clinical variables). Results For discharge outcome prediction, models were optimized/trained on n = 494 and tested on an independent cohort of n = 100 patients from Yale. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the independent cohort showed no significant difference between best-performing Combined input models (area under the curve, AUC = 0.77) versus Radiomics + Treatment (AUC = 0.78, p = 0.78), Radiomics (AUC = 0.78, p = 0.55), or Clinical + Treatment (AUC = 0.77, p = 0.87) models. For 3-month outcome prediction, models were optimized/trained on n = 373 and tested on an independent cohort from Yale (n = 72), and an external cohort from Geisinger Medical Center (n = 232). In the independent cohort, there was no significant difference between Combined input models (AUC = 0.76) versus Radiomics + Treatment (AUC = 0.72, p = 0.39), Radiomics (AUC = 0.72, p = 0.39), or Clinical + Treatment (AUC = 76, p = 0.90) models; however, in the external cohort, the Combined model (AUC = 0.74) outperformed Radiomics + Treatment (AUC = 0.66, p < 0.001) and Radiomics (AUC = 0.68, p = 0.005) models for 3-month prediction. Conclusion Machine-learning signatures of admission CTA radiomics can provide prognostic information in acute LVO stroke candidates for mechanical thrombectomy. Such objective and time-sensitive risk stratification can guide treatment decisions and facilitate tele-stroke assessment of patients. Particularly in the absence of reliable clinical information at the time of admission, models solely using radiomics features can provide a useful prognostication tool.},

   abstract = {Can one learn to diagnose COVID-19 under extreme minimal supervision? Since the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 there has been a rush for developing automatic techniques for expert-level disease identification on Chest X-ray data. In particular, the use of deep supervised learning has become the go-to paradigm. However, the performance of such models is heavily dependent on the availability of a large and representative labelled dataset. The creation of which is a heavily expensive and time consuming task, and especially imposes a great challenge for a novel disease. Semi-supervised learning has shown the ability to match the incredible performance of supervised models whilst requiring a small fraction of the labelled examples. This makes the semi supervised paradigm an attractive option for identifying COVID-19. In this work, we introduce a graph based deep semi-supervised framework for classifying COVID-19 from chest X-rays. Our framework introduces an optimisation model for graph diffusion that reinforces the natural relation among the tiny labelled set and the vast unlabelled data. We then connect the diffusion prediction output as pseudo-labels that are used in an iterative scheme in a deep net. We demonstrate, through our experiments, that our model is able to outperform the current leading supervised model with a tiny fraction of the labelled examples. Finally, we provide attention maps to accommodate the radiologist's mental model, better fitting their perceptual and cognitive abilities. These visualisation aims to assist the radiologist in judging whether the diagnostic is correct or not, and in consequence to accelerate the decision.},

   abstract = {Background:over the last year, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants have highlighted the importance of screening tools with high diagnostic accuracy for new illnesses such as COVID-19. In that regard, deep learning approaches have proven as effective solutions for pneumonia classification, especially when considering chest-x-rays images. However, this lung infection can also be caused by other viral, bacterial or fungi pathogens. Consequently, efforts are being poured toward distinguishing the infection source to help clinicians to diagnose the correct disease origin. Following this tendency, this study further explores the effectiveness of established neural network architectures on the pneumonia classification task through the transfer learning paradigm. Methodology:to present a comprehensive comparison, 12 well-known ImageNet pre-trained models were fine-tuned and used to discriminate among chest-x-rays of healthy people, and those showing pneumonia symptoms derived from either a viral (i.e., generic or SARS-CoV-2) or bacterial source. Furthermore, since a common public collection distinguishing between such categories is currently not available, two distinct datasets of chest-x-rays images, describing the aforementioned sources, were combined and employed to evaluate the various architectures. Results:the experiments were performed using a total of 6330 images split between train, validation, and test sets. For all models, standard classification metrics were computed (e.g., precision, f1-score), and most architectures obtained significant performances, reaching, among the others, up to 84.46% average f1-score when discriminating the four identified classes. Moreover, execution times, areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), confusion matrices, activation maps computed via the Grad-CAM algorithm, and additional experiments to assess the robustness of each model using only 50%, 20%, and 10% of the training set were also reported to present an informed discussion on the networks classifications. Conclusion: this paper examines the effectiveness of well-known architectures on a joint collection of chest-x-rays presenting pneumonia cases derived from either viral or bacterial sources, with particular attention to SARS-CoV-2 contagions for viral pathogens; demonstrating that existing architectures can effectively diagnose pneumonia sources and suggesting that the transfer learning paradigm could be a crucial asset in diagnosing future unknown illnesses.},

   abstract = {Pandemics and many other diseases threaten human life, health and quality of life by affecting many aspects. For this reason, the medical diagnosis to be applied for any disease is important in terms of the most accurate determination by the doctors and the appropriate treatment for the determined diagnosis. The COVID-19 pandemic that started in China in December 2019 spread all over the world in a short time. Researchers have begun to do different studies to make the most accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, doctors in the health sector of many countries were also caught off guard. Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) are of great importance in the development of computer-aided early and accurate diagnosis systems in today's medical field, as they greatly assist doctors in the medical diagnosis process. In this study, a method was proposed for the most accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 patients using the COVID-19 image data. Images were first standardized and features extracted using RGB values of 800x800 images, and these features were used in train and test processes for MLAs. 5 different MLAs were used in experimental studies using statistical measurements (k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Decision Tree (DT), Multinominal Logistic Regression (MLR), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). A method was proposed that automatically finds the highest classification success that these algorithms can achieve. In experimental studies, the following accuracy rates were obtained in train operations for MLAs, respectively; 1, 1, 1, 0.69565, 0.92753. Accuracy results in test operations were obtained as follows; 0.85714, 0.79591, 0.91836, 0.61224, 0.89795. After the application of the proposed method, the test success rate for MLR increased from 0.91 to 0.98. As a result of applying the proposed algorithm, more accurate results were obtained. The results obtained were given in the experimental studies section in detail. The results obtained proved to be very promising. According to the results, it was seen that the proposed method could be used effectively in future studies.},

An optimal allocation strategy, especially in countries with access inequities and temporal separation of hot-spots, might be an effective way of halting the disease spread. We approach this problem by proposing a novel pipeline VacSIM that dovetails Deep Reinforcement Learning models into a Contextual Bandits approach for optimizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. Whereas the Reinforcement Learning models suggest better actions and rewards, Contextual Bandits allow online modifications that may need to be implemented on a day-to-day basis in the real world scenario. We evaluate this framework against a naive allocation approach of distributing vaccine proportional to the incidence of COVID-19 cases in five different States across India (Assam, Delhi, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Nagaland) and demonstrate up to 9039 potential infections prevented and a significant increase in the efficacy of limiting the spread over a period of 45 days through the VacSIM approach. Our models and the platform are extensible to all states of India and potentially across the globe. We also propose novel evaluation strategies including standard compartmental model-based projections and a causality-preserving evaluation of our model. Since all models carry assumptions that may need to be tested in various contexts, we open source our model VacSIM and contribute a new reinforcement learning environment compatible with OpenAI gym to make it extensible for real-world applications across the globe.

   abstract = {Background: Automatic e-coaching may motivate individuals to lead a healthy lifestyle with early health risk prediction, personalized recommendation generation, and goal evaluation. Multiple studies have reported on uninterrupted and automatic monitoring of behavioral aspects (such as sedentary time, amount, and type of physical activity); however, e-coaching and personalized feedback techniques are still in a nascent stage. Current intelligent coaching strategies are mostly based on the handcrafted string messages that rarely individualize to each user's needs, context, and preferences. Therefore, more realistic, flexible, practical, sophisticated, and engaging strategies are needed to model personalized recommendations. Objective: This study aims to design and develop an ontology to model personalized recommendation message intent, components (such as suggestion, feedback, argument, and follow-ups), and contents (such as spatial and temporal content and objects relevant to perform the recommended activities). A reasoning technique will help to discover implied knowledge from the proposed ontology. Furthermore, recommendation messages can be classified into different categories in the proposed ontology. Methods: The ontology was created using Protégé (version 5.5.0) open-source software. We used the Java-based Jena Framework (version 3.16) to build a semantic web application as a proof of concept, which included Resource Description Framework application programming interface, World Wide Web Consortium Web Ontology Language application programming interface, native tuple database, and SPARQL Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language query engine. The HermiT (version 1.4.3.x) ontology reasoner available in Protégé 5.x implemented the logical and structural consistency of the proposed ontology. To verify the proposed ontology model, we simulated data for 8 test cases. The personalized recommendation messages were generated based on the processing of personal activity data in combination with contextual weather data and personal preference data. The developed ontology was processed using a query engine against a rule base to generate personalized recommendations. Results: The proposed ontology was implemented in automatic activity coaching to generate and deliver meaningful, personalized lifestyle recommendations. The ontology can be visualized using OWLViz and OntoGraf. In addition, we developed an ontology verification module that behaves similar to a rule-based decision support system to analyze the generation and delivery of personalized recommendation messages following a logical structure. Conclusions: This study led to the creation of a meaningful ontology to generate and model personalized recommendation messages for physical activity coaching.},

   abstract = {The fact that cloud systems are under the increasing risks of cyber attacks has made the phenomenon of information security first a need and then a necessity for these systems. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can exploit, disrupt, change, prevent or damage cloud services. Accurate and timely detection and prevention of these attacks are very important in terms of ensuring information security. During the COVID-19 period, the increase in the use of information technologies and especially the internet has made cyber attacks a real concern. Deep learning (DL) has become widely used for the purpose of detecting and preventing cyber attacks to provide information security. In this study, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based system (LSTM-CLOUD) which was designed for the detection and prevention of DDoS attacks in a public cloud network environment was proposed. The design of the system is based on a signature-based attack detection approach. The LSTM-CLOUD has two modules defined in the study: detection and defense. The function of the first module of the system was determined as detecting the occurrence of DDoS attacks with the LSTM DL model developed in this study with an accuracy rate of 99.83% on the CICDDoS2019 data set. The function of the second module was determined as activating the defense mechanism to protect the cloud systems when attacks are detected. The comparison results showed that our LSTM model had a performance as good as those in the previous studies conducted with different DL algorithms on the same and different datasets. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the LSTM model developed in this study in detecting the occurrence of attacks.},

   abstract = {The spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 presents many challenges to healthcare systems and infrastructures across the world, exacerbating inequalities and leaving the world's most vulnerable populations at risk. Epidemiological modelling is vital to guiding evidence-informed or data-driven decision making. In forced displacement contexts, and in particular refugee and internally displaced people (IDP) settlements, it meets several challenges including data availability and quality, the applicability of existing models to those contexts, the accurate modelling of cultural differences or specificities of those operational settings, the communication of results and uncertainties, as well as the alignment of strategic goals between diverse partners in complex situations. In this paper, we systematically review the limited epidemiological modelling work applied to refugee and IDP settlements so far, and discuss challenges and identify lessons learnt from the process. With the likelihood of disease outbreaks expected to increase in the future as more people are displaced due to conflict and climate change, we call for the development of more approaches and models specifically designed to include the unique features and populations of refugee and IDP settlements. To strengthen collaboration between the modelling and the humanitarian public health communities, we propose a roadmap to encourage the development of systems and frameworks to share needs, build tools and coordinate responses in an efficient and scalable manner, both for this pandemic and for future outbreaks.},

In this study, we considered two open sources and one real-world dataset and observed the behavior of ARIMA, ANN, and LSTM concerning changes in input parameters. It was found that no model observed the change in input parameters until it was manually introduced. It was observed that considered models experienced performance degradation and deterioration from 5 to 15% in terms of accuracy relating to parameter change. Therefore, to improve the model accuracy and adapt the parametric variations, which are dynamic in nature and evident in S.G. and D.G.M. environments.

Amongst the multitude of approaches to SHM, the Digital Twin model is gaining increasing attention. This model is a digital reconstruction (the Digital Twin) of a real-life asset (the Physical Twin) that, in contrast to other digital models, is frequently and automatically updated using data sampled by a sensor network deployed on the latter. This tool can provide infrastructure managers with functionalities to monitor and optimize their asset stock and to make informed and data-based decisions, in the context of day-to-day operative conditions and after extreme events. These data not only include sensor data, but also include regularly revalidated structural reliability indices formulated on the grounds of the frequently updated Digital Twin model. The technology can be even pushed as far as performing structural behavioral predictions and automatically compensating for them. The present exploratory review covers the key Digital Twin aspects—its usefulness, modus operandi, application, etc.—and proves the suitability of Distributed Sensing as its network sensor component.},

The work done deals with developing an AI-based framework that can help radiologists and other healthcare professionals diagnose COVID-19 cases at a high level of accuracy. However, in the absence of publicly available CT datasets, the development of such AI tools can prove challenging. Therefore, an algorithm for performing automatic and accurate COVID-19 classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pre-trained model, and Sparrow search algorithm (SSA) on CT lung images was proposed. The pre-trained CNN models used are SeresNext50, SeresNext101, SeNet154, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3Small, and MobileNetV3Large. In addition, the SSA will be used to optimize the different CNN and transfer learning(TL) hyperparameters to find the best configuration for the pre-trained model used and enhance its performance. Two datasets are used in the experiments. There are two classes in the first dataset, while three in the second. The authors combined two publicly available COVID-19 datasets as the first dataset, namely the COVID-19 Lung CT Scans and COVID-19 CT Scan Dataset. In total, 14,486 images were included in this study. The authors analyzed the Large COVID-19 CT scan slice dataset in the second dataset, which utilized 17,104 images. Compared to other pre-trained models on both classes datasets, MobileNetV3Large pre-trained is the best model. As far as the three-classes dataset is concerned, a model trained on SeNet154 is the best available. Results show that, when compared to other CNN models like LeNet-5 CNN, COVID faster R–CNN, Light CNN, Fuzzy + CNN, Dynamic CNN, CNN and Optimized CNN, the proposed Framework achieves the best accuracy of 99.74% (two classes) and 98% (three classes).},

The aim of this study was to assess the mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to IL-6 serum levels and new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) according to PaO2 /FiO2 stratification. Materials and Methods: 175 COVID-19 patients (25 new-onset AF, 22 other types of AF and 128 no-AF) were included in this single-center, retrospective study; clinical and demographic data, vital signs, electrocardiograms and laboratory results were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate the mortality rate in new-onset AF patients according to IL-6 serum levels and PaO2 /FiO2 stratification. Results: The incidence of new-onset AF in the study population was 14.2%. Compared to the no-AF group, new-onset AF patients were older with a positive history of chronic kidney disease and heart failure, had higher IL-6, creatinine and urea serum levels whereas their platelet count was reduced. After PaO2 /FiO2 stratification, 5-days mortality rate was higher in new-onset AF patients compared to patients with other types of AF and no-AF patients, and mortality risk increases 5.3 fold compared to no-AF (p = 0.0014) and 4.8 fold compared to other forms of AF (p = 0.03). Conclusions: New-onset AF is common in COVID-19 patients and is associated with increased IL-6 serum levels and early mortality. Further studies are needed to support the use of IL-6 as an early molecular target for COVID-19 patients to reduce their high rate of mortality.},

Active travel is currently gaining popularity worldwide as a sustainable form of travel. However, very few studies have examined how the built environment affects active travel behaviour on university campuses, particularly in China. It is a key feature of Chinese university campuses that they are generally gated communities, which are spatially organised in a very different way from campuses in other countries, and they often also provide for students’ daily needs, meaning that students tend to travel off-campus less frequently.
Aims
This research aims to explore the link between street greenery and the active travel behaviour of students on closed university campuses in China.
Methods
The study combined sensor data from Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre (HEMC), China, with individual cross-sectional survey data from university students and applied a multilevel logistic regression model to conduct the analysis. Street-view images were analysed using a deep learning approach, which represents an emerging method for assessing urban green space.
Results
The results demonstrated that street greenery on campuses is positively associated with active travel among university students. Modes of travel also influenced active travel, with university students who owned bicycles tending to participate in active travel more; however, those who travelled by electric bikes were less likely to participate in active travel.
Conclusions
This study suggests that policymakers and transport planners should focus more on greening urban areas and improving walking and cycling environments to achieve green transport goals through urban planning.},

Twitter data were gathered using the hash tags Chinese virus and Kung Flu in the month of March 2020, resulting in 7,454 clean tweets. Negative tweets extracted using sentiment analysis were annotated (Racism, Sarcasm/irony and Others), and used to train several machine learning models. Experimental results show Random Forest with bagging to consistently outperform Random Forest, J48 and Support Vector Machine with an accuracy of 78.1% (Racism versus Sarcasm/Irony) and 77.9% (Racism versus Others). LDA revealed three distinct topics for tweets identified as racist, namely, Eating habit, Political hatred and Xenophobia. Consistent detection performance of the models evaluated indicate their reliability in detecting cyber-racism patterns based on textual communications.},

   abstract = {There are two broad views as to why people stay poor. One emphasizes differences in fundamentals, such as ability, talent, or motivation. The poverty traps view emphasizes differences in opportunities that stem from access to wealth. To test these views, we exploit a large-scale, randomized asset transfer and an 11-year panel of 6,000 households who begin in extreme poverty. The setting is rural Bangladesh, and the assets are cows. The data support the poverty traps view - we identify a threshold level of initial assets above which households accumulate assets, take on better occupations (from casual labor in agriculture or domestic services to running small livestock businesses), and grow out of poverty. The reverse happens for those below the threshold. Structural estimation of an occupational choice model reveals that almost all beneficiaries are misallocated in the work they do at baseline and that the gains arising from eliminating misallocation would far exceed the program costs. Our findings imply that large transfers, which create better jobs for the poor, are an effective means of getting people out of poverty traps and reducing global poverty.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic led to dramatic economic disruptions, including government-imposed restrictions that temporarily shuttered millions of American businesses. We use a nationwide survey of thousands of small business owners to establish three main facts about business owners’ decisions to reopen at the end of the lockdowns. First, roughly 60 percent of firms planned to reopen within days of the end of legal restrictions, suggesting that the lockdowns were generally binding for businesses—although nearly 30 percent expected to delay their reopening by at least a month. Second, decisions to delay reopenings did not seem to be driven by concerns about employee or customer health; even businesses in high-proximity sectors with the highest health risks generally reported intentions to reopen as soon as regulations allowed. Third, pessimistic demand projections primarily explain delays among firms that could legally reopen. Owners expected demand to be one-third lower than before the crisis throughout the pandemic. Using experimentally induced shocks to perceived demand, we find that a 10 percent decline in expected demand results in a 1.5 percentage point (8 percent) increase in the likelihood that firms expected to remain closed for at least one month after being legally able to open. We use follow-up surveys to cross-validate expectations with realized outcomes. Overall, our results suggest that governments set more stringent guidelines for reopening than what many businesses would have selected, suggesting that governments may have internalized costs of contagion that businesses did not.},

In addition to examining the correlation between students’ perception of cognitive, teaching and social presences on their perception of blended learning, the correlation between technological and financial factors as well as demographic data on the intention to enrol in blended learning in the future is examined. The study surveyed one hundred and fifteen students from female Saudi Universities who are enrolled in a design major. The results revealed that the teaching, cognitive and social presences constructs are predictors of students’ perception and acceptance of blended learning. Further, the facilitating conditions and efforts expectancy are also predictors of the perception of blended learning. The study also found that there is a significant correlation between the CoI and the selected constructs from the UTAUT when it comes to studying students’ perception of blended learning.},

   abstract = {It has been reported that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 become critically ill primarily around the time of activation of the adaptive immune response. However the role of antibodies in the worsening of disease is not obvious. Higher titers of anti-spike immunoglobulin IgG1 associated with low fucosylation of the antibody Fc tail have been associated to excessive inflammatory response. In contrast it has been also reported that NP-, S-, RBD- specific IgA, IgG, and IgM are not associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load, indicating that there is no obvious correlation between antibody response and viral antigen detection. In the present work the micro-Fourier-transform infrared reflectance spectroscopy (micro-FTIR) was employed to investigate blood serum samples of healthy and COVID-19-ill (mild or oligosymptomatic) individuals (82 healthcare workers volunteers in “Instituto de Infectologia Emilio Ribas”, São Paulo, Brazil). The molecular-level-sensitive, multiplexing quantitative and qualitative FTIR data probed on 1 µL of dried biofluid was compared to signal-to-cutoff index of chemiluminescent immunoassays CLIA and ELISA (IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2). Our main result indicated that 1702–1785 cm - 1 spectral window (carbonyl C=O vibration) is a spectral marker of the degree of IgG glycosylation, allowing to probe distinctive sub-populations of COVID-19 patients, depending on their degree of severity. The specificity was 87.5 % while the detection rate of true positive was 100%. The computed area under the receiver operating curve was equivalent to CLIA, ELISA and other ATR-FTIR methods (> 0.85). In summary, overall discrimination of healthy and COVID-19 individuals and severity prediction as well could be potentially implemented using micro-FTIR reflectance spectroscopy on blood serum samples. Considering the minimal and reagent-free sample preparation procedures combined to fast (few minutes) outcome of FTIR we can state that this technology is suitable for fast screening of immune response of individuals with COVID-19. It would be an important tool in prospective studies, helping investigate the physiology of the asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic, or severe individuals and measure the extension of infection dissemination in patients.},

   abstract = {Estimating human mobility responses to the large-scale spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial, since its significance guides policymakers to give Non-pharmaceutical Interventions, such as closure or reopening of businesses. It is challenging to model due to complex social contexts and limited training data. Recently, we proposed a conditional generative adversarial network (COVID-GAN) to estimate human mobility response under a set of social and policy conditions integrated from multiple data sources. Although COVID-GAN achieves a good average estimation accuracy under real-world conditions, it produces higher errors in certain regions due to the presence of spatial heterogeneity and outliers. To address these issues, in this article, we extend our prior work by introducing a new spatio-temporal deep generative model, namely, COVID-GAN+. COVID-GAN+ deals with the spatial heterogeneity issue by introducing a new spatial feature layer that utilizes the local Moran statistic to model the spatial heterogeneity strength in the data. In addition, we redesign the training objective to learn the estimated mobility changes from historical average levels to mitigate the effects of spatial outliers. We perform comprehensive evaluations using urban mobility data derived from cell phone records and census data. Results show that COVID-GAN+ can better approximate real-world human mobility responses than prior methods, including COVID-GAN.},

Radiology and nucleic acid test (NAT) are complementary COVID-19 diagnosis methods. In this paper, we present an end-to-end multitask learning (MTL) framework (COVID-MTL) that is capable of automated and simultaneous detection (against both radiology and NAT) and severity assessment of COVID-19. COVID-MTL learns different COVID-19 tasks in parallel through our novel random-weighted loss function, which assigns learning weights under Dirichlet distribution to prevent task dominance; our new 3D real-time augmentation algorithm (Shift3D) introduces space variances for 3D CNN components by shifting low-level feature representations of volumetric inputs in three dimensions; thereby, the MTL framework is able to accelerate convergence and improve joint learning performance compared to single-task models. By only using chest CT scans, COVID-MTL was trained on 930 CT scans and tested on separate 399 cases. COVID-MTL achieved AUCs of 0.939 and 0.846, and accuracies of 90.23% and 79.20% for detection of COVID-19 against radiology and NAT, respectively, which outperformed the state-of-the-art models. Meanwhile, COVID-MTL yielded AUC of 0.800 ± 0.020 and 0.813 ± 0.021 (with transfer learning) for classifying control/suspected, mild/regular, and severe/critically-ill cases. To decipher the recognition mechanism, we also identified high-throughput lung features that were significantly related (P < 0.001) to the positivity and severity of COVID-19.},

The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented focus on infection prevention; however, waves of COVID-19 follow one another, asymptomatic cases are nearly impossible to identify by triage in a dental setting, and the effectiveness of long-lasting immune protection through vaccination remains largely unknown. Different national laws and international guidelines (mainly USA-CDC, ECDC) have often brought about dissimilar awareness and operational choices, and in general, there has been very limited attention to this technology. Here, we discuss its advantages and limitations in light of: (a) presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the oral cavity, saliva, and dental biofilm and activation of dormant microbial infections; (b) the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by aerosol and fomite contamination; (c) the detection of various oral manifestations of COVID-19; (d) specific information for the reprocessing of the scanner tip and the ward from the manufacturers.},

To predict changes in income and the associated effects on poverty, we rely on existing estimated macroeconomic impacts. We assume two main impact channels: direct income/wage and employment losses. Our simulations suggest that consumption decreased by 7.1%–14.4% and that poverty increased by 4.3–9.9 percentage points in 2020. This points to a reversal of the positive poverty reduction trend observed in previous years. Poverty most certainly increased in the pre-COVID period due to other shocks, so Mozambique finds itself in a deepening struggle against poverty.},

   abstract = {Problem definition: Physical distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic have dramatically reduced the effective capacity of university campuses. Under these conditions, we examine how to make the most of newly scarce resources in the related problems of curriculum planning and course timetabling. Academic/practical relevance: We propose a unified model for university course scheduling problems under a two-stage framework and draw parallels between component problems while showing how to accommodate individual specifics. During the pandemic, our models were critical to measuring the impact of several innovative proposals, including expanding the academic calendar, teaching across multiple rooms, and rotating student attendance through the week and school year. Methodology: We use integer optimization combined with enrollment data from thousands of past students. Our models scale to thousands of individual students enrolled in hundreds of courses. Results: We projected that if Massachusetts Institute of Technology moved from its usual two-semester calendar to a three-semester calendar, with each student attending two semesters in person, more than 90% of student course demand could be satisfied on campus without increasing faculty workloads. For the Sloan School of Management, we produced a new schedule that was implemented in fall 2020. The schedule allowed half of Sloan courses to include an in-person component while adhering to safety guidelines. Despite a fourfold reduction in classroom capacity, it afforded two thirds of Sloan students the opportunity for in-person learning in at least half their courses. Managerial implications: Integer optimization can enable decision making at a large scale in a domain that is usually managed manually by university administrators. Our models, although inspired by the pandemic, are generic and could apply to any scheduling problem under severe capacity constraints.},

Unfortunately, the success of these systems has been limited, partly owing to poor interoperability with manual contact tracing, low adoption rates, and a societally sensitive trade-off between utility and privacy. In this work, we introduce a new privacy-preserving and inclusive system for epidemic risk assessment and notification that aims to address these limitations. Rather than capturing pairwise encounters between user devices as done by existing systems, our system captures encounters between user devices and beacons placed in strategic locations where infection clusters may originate. Epidemiological simulations using an agent-based model demonstrate that, by utilizing location and environmental information and interoperating with manual contact tracing, our system can increase the accuracy of contact tracing actions and may help reduce epidemic spread already at low adoption.},

   abstract = {The pandemic has forced people to use digital technologies and accelerated the digitalization of many businesses. Using digital technologies generates a huge amount of data that are exploited by Business Intelligence (BI) to make decisions and improve the management of firms. This becomes particularly relevant in the healthcare sector where decisions are traditionally made on the physicians’ experience. Much work has been done on applying BI in the healthcare industry. Most of these studies were focused only on IT or medical aspects, while the usage of BI for improving the management of healthcare processes is an under-investigated field. This research aims at filling this gap by investigating whether a decision support system (DSS) model based on the exploitation of data through BI can outperform traditional experience-driven practices for managing processes in the healthcare domain. Focusing on the managing process of the therapeutic path of oncological patients, specifically BRCA-mutated women with breast cancer, a DSS model for benchmarking the costs of various treatment paths was developed in two versions: the first is experience-driven while the second is data-driven. We found that the data-driven version of the DSS model leads to a more accurate estimation of the costs that could potentially be prevented in the treatment of oncological patients, thus enabling significant cost savings. A more informed decision due to a more accurate cost estimation becomes crucial in a context where optimal treatment and unique clinical recommendations for patients are absent, thus permitting a substantial improvement of the decision making in the healthcare industry.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a new classification of occupations based on the extent to which they put workers at risk of being infected by aerial-transmitted viruses. We expand on previous work that mainly focused on the identification of jobs that can be done from home by providing a more nuanced view of infection risks: in particular, we identify jobs that, although impossible to be done from home, expose workers to a low risk of infection. Jobs that cannot be done from home and that present a high risk of infection are labelled ‘unsafe jobs’. We then combine our classification of infection risk with a list of ‘essential occupations’ that have been carried out even during the most severe lockdown measures: this provides a taxonomy ranking jobs along two dimensions, one related to workers’ health and the other related to economic conditions. Using both survey and administrative data, we show that this taxonomy successfully predicts outcomes along these two dimensions, such as sick leaves, COVID-19-related work injuries, recourse to short-time work (STW) schemes and work from home. We also find that unsafe jobs are very unequally distributed across different types of workers, firms and sectors. Workers who are more vulnerable economically (women, youngsters, low educated, immigrants and workers on fixed-term contracts) are more likely to hold unsafe jobs and therefore more at risk of suffering from the economic consequences of a prolonged pandemic. We finally discuss possible paths to reform social protection systems, so that they can better support workers during the labour market adjustments that are likely to be spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Several biomarkers can be altered in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and they can be associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and outcomes. The most used biomarkers in COVID-19 include several proinflammatory cytokines, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), neutrophil count, neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio, troponins, creatine kinase (MB), myoglobin, D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and its N-terminal pro-hormone (NT-proBNP). Some of these biomarkers can be readily used to predict disease severity, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality, while others, such as metabolomic and proteomic analysis, have not yet translated to clinical practice. This narrative review aims to identify laboratory biomarkers that have shown significant diagnostic and prognostic value for risk stratification in COVID-19 and discuss the possible clinical application of novel analytic strategies, like metabolomics and proteomics. Future research should focus on identifying a limited but essential number of laboratory biomarkers to easily predict prognosis and outcome in severe COVID-19.},

Changes in the system on which the ML model has been trained may lead to performance degradation during the system's life cycle. Recent advances that study non-stationary environments have mainly focused on identifying and addressing such changes caused by a phenomenon called concept drift. Different terms have been used in the literature to refer to the same type of concept drift and the same term for various types. This lack of unified terminology is set out to create confusion on distinguishing between different concept drift variants. In this paper, we start by grouping concept drift types by their mathematical definitions and survey the different terms used in the literature to build a consolidated taxonomy of the field. We also review and classify performance-based concept drift detection methods proposed in the last decade. These methods utilize the predictive model's performance degradation to signal substantial changes in the systems. The classification is outlined in a hierarchical diagram to provide an orderly navigation between the methods. We present a comprehensive analysis of the main attributes and strategies for tracking and evaluating the model's performance in the predictive system. The paper concludes by discussing open research challenges and possible research directions.},

   abstract = {Communication can be defined as the understanding and exchanging of meaningful messages. The role of communication is central to the lives of human beings as, everyday, we use language to interact with the world around us. Linguistic skills play a fundamental role in this scenario and Language Disorders (LD) are impairments that limit the processing of linguistic information. Early and accurate identification of LD is thus essential to promote lifelong learning and well-being. From an evolutionary perspective, some human language constructs evolved from an ancestral motor system and share the same neural pathways in the Broca’s area of the brain. This suggests a correlation between action and language. If such a relationship is well established and reliable, it would be possible to use the former as a marker of the latter. The hypothesis of our work, in a nutshell, is that movement can be a predictor of language. To study this correlation, we developed C(H)o(L)ordination, a Mixed Reality (MR) application for HoloLens 2. The application offers several activities based on visual stimuli involving motor movements, which tap on the same skills needed to perform some language tasks. We performed an exploratory study with N=22 users to test the application usability and user experience. The results suggest that C(H)o(L)ordination is a usable and powerful tool to gather insights on the ongoing debate about language evolution and language disorders.},

We show that the phenomenon of “human spreading” shares key features with phenomena that are fundamental in physics (heat, electricity, species, Darcy fluid flow), which spread through continua. As example for discussion and illustration, we construct this theoretical framework by using the early phase of the coronavirus outbreak, from before May 2020. The human spreading phenomenon (S curve) is unveiled systematically by using a minimum of measurable parameters: the number of persons with whom one person comes in contact, the radial size of each step in the growth of the swept territory, the radial scale of the inhabited territory, and the directions in which infrastructure (e.g., air routes) are available for long and fast spreading. The resulting configuration of spreading is a multiscale assembly of clusters of fast channels embedded in interstices with slow diffusion. The configuration is dendritic, where each direction of long and fast spreading is covered by a finger of clusters, and each finger generates its own ramifications. The similarities between this configuration and the dendritic architectures for heat and fluid flow through heterogeneous media are discussed.},

Cloud infrastructures typically consist of heterogeneous servers, hosting multiple virtual machines with potentially different specifications, and volatile resource usage. This makes the resource allocation face many issues such as energy conservation, fault tolerance, workload balancing, etc. Finding a comprehensive solution that considers all these issues is one of the essential concerns of cloud service providers. This paper presents a new resource allocation model based on an intelligent multi-agent system and reinforcement learning method (IMARM). It combines the multi-agent characteristics and the Q-learning process to improve the performance of cloud resource allocation. IMARM uses the properties of multi-agent systems to dynamically allocate and release resources, thus responding well to changing consumer demands. Meanwhile, the reinforcement learning policy makes virtual machines move to the best state according to the current state environment. Also, we study the impact of IMARM on execution time. The experimental results showed that our proposed solution performs better than other comparable algorithms regarding energy consumption and fault tolerance, with reasonable load balancing and respectful execution time.},

However, it remains unclear how AM technology might be able to simultaneously build supply chain efficiency and resilience, given the often conflicting nature of these qualities. This paper employs an ambidextrous perspective on dynamic capability theory to investigate the potential of AM technology to solve this resilience-efficiency dilemma at the supply chain level. The research design involves a hybrid approach, combining focus groups and multiple case studies, with particular attention paid to the African supply chain context. The findings indicate that AM technology presents the potential to develop ambidextrous dynamic capabilities, leading to the reconciliation of resilience and efficiency at the supply chain level. Some determinants, such as data-driven systems, supply chain collaboration, innovation agility and knowledge are found to be critical to enable the development of those capabilities around AM-enabled manufacturing systems. The study contributes to the preparation of the global supply chain for the post-COVID era, where digital technologies such as AM will be fundamental for both building resilience and efficiency simultaneously. Practitioners in emerging economies may benefit directly from the outcomes of this study. Furthermore, managers and policy-makers in developed countries may be made aware of the significance of using AM technology in emerging countries to enhance the performance of the global supply chain.},

Nonetheless, they exploit deep learning methodologies, which require burdensome labeling procedures to perform training. To address these shortcomings, we present a novel approach that performs yield estimation requiring only a monocular camera and needs a limited amount of supervision information. It detects, locates and maps fruits and tree canopies to estimate the total yield of a specific crop. To keep the image labeling effort to a minimum, we propose a weakly-supervision paradigm that only requires a simple binary label encoding the presence or the absence of fruits in the training images. Our approach does not make any assumptions on the underlying platform, i.e., it can be used by collecting images either with a hand-held camera or with an autonomous robot. Therefore, we are able to considerably reduce the deployment time, the energy and the cost of the overall yield estimation system. At the same time, we keep the performance comparable to both vision-based fully supervised baselines (which require costly labeling operations) and classical systems that rely on more expensive and power-demanding sensors.},

   abstract = {To define appropriate planning scenarios for future pandemics of respiratory pathogens, it is important to understand the initial transmission dynamics of COVID-19 during 2020. Here, we fit an age-stratified compartmental model with a flexible underlying transmission term to daily COVID-19 death data from states in the contiguous U.S. and to national and sub-national data from around the world. The daily death data of the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic was categorized into one of four main types: spring single-peak profile, summer single-peak profile, spring/summer two-peak profile and broad with shoulder profile. We estimated a reproduction number R as a function of calendar time tc and as a function of time since the first death reported in that population (local pandemic time, tp). Contrary to the multiple categories and range of magnitudes in death incidence profiles, the R(tp) profiles were much more homogeneous. We find that in both the contiguous U.S. and globally, the initial value of both R(tc) and R(tp) was substantial: at or above two. However, during the early months, pandemic time R(tp) decreased exponentially to a value that hovered around one. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in the variance of R(tp). For calendar time R(tc), the decrease in magnitude was slower and non-exponential, with a smaller reduction in variance. Intriguingly, similar trends of exponential decrease and reduced variance were not observed in raw death data. Our findings suggest that the combination of specific government responses and spontaneous changes in behaviour ensured that transmissibility dropped, rather than remaining constant, during the initial phases of a pandemic. Future pandemic planning scenarios should be based on models that assume similar decreases in transmissibility, which lead to longer epidemics with lower peaks when compared with models based on constant transmissibility.Author summary In planning for a future novel respiratory pandemic, or the next variant of SARS-Cov-2, it is important to characterize and understand the observed epidemic patterns during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak. Here, we describe COVID-19 epidemic patterns observed in the U.S. and globally in terms of patterns of the basic reproduction number, R(t), using an age-stratified compartmental model. We find that daily death data of the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic can be classified into one of four types: spring single-peak profile, summer single-peak profile, spring/summer two-peak profile and broad with shoulder profile. Using the concept of local pandemic time, tp, we show a consistent pattern on four continents of an initial large magnitude and variance in reproductive number R(tp) that decreases monotonically and hovers around one for many days, regardless of specific intervention measures imposed by local authorities and without an accompanying decrease in daily death prevalence. We attribute this to significant behavior changes in populations in response to the perceived risk of COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the 348 National Science Foundation Award number 2031536, and by Cooperative Agreement 349 number NU38OT000297 from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 350 and CSTE and does not necessarily represent the views of CDC and CSTE.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

   abstract = {In hypoxemic patients at risk for developing respiratory failure, the decision to initiate invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) may be extremely difficult, even more so among patients suffering from COVID-19. Delayed recognition of respiratory failure may translate into poor outcomes, emphasizing the need for stronger predictive models for IMV necessity. We developed a two-step model; the first step was to train a machine learning predictive model on a large dataset of non-COVID-19 critically ill hypoxemic patients from the United States (MIMIC-III). The second step was to apply transfer learning and adapt the model to a smaller COVID-19 cohort. An XGBoost algorithm was trained on data from the MIMIC-III database to predict if a patient would require IMV within the next 6, 12, 18 or 24 h. Patients’ datasets were used to construct the model as time series of dynamic measurements and laboratory results obtained during the previous 6 h with additional static variables, applying a sliding time-window once every hour. We validated the adaptation algorithm on a cohort of 1061 COVID-19 patients from a single center in Israel, of whom 160 later deteriorated and required IMV. The new XGBoost model for the prediction of the IMV onset was trained and tested on MIMIC-III data and proved to be predictive, with an AUC of 0.83 on a shortened set of features, excluding the clinician’s settings, and an AUC of 0.91 when the clinician settings were included. Applying these models “as is” (no adaptation applied) on the dataset of COVID-19 patients degraded the prediction results to AUCs of 0.78 and 0.80, without and with the clinician’s settings, respectively. Applying the adaptation on the COVID-19 dataset increased the prediction power to an AUC of 0.94 and 0.97, respectively. Good AUC results get worse with low overall precision. We show that precision of the prediction increased as prediction probability was higher. Our model was successfully trained on a specific dataset, and after adaptation it showed promise in predicting outcome on a completely different dataset. This two-step model successfully predicted the need for invasive mechanical ventilation 6, 12, 18 or 24 h in advance in both general ICU population and COVID-19 patients. Using the prediction probability as an indicator of the precision carries the potential to aid the decision-making process in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure despite the low overall precision.},

   abstract = {The main aim of this paper is to investigate the stylized facts associated with the volatility of precious metals before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using GARCH-type models. In particular, we employ an ARMA-GARCH, ARMA-EGARCH and ARMA-FIGARCH framework to account for volatility clustering, asymmetry and long memory in the volatility of gold, silver, platinum and palladium. Based on structural breaks, we divide the whole sample into sub-samples and find that the breakpoints occurred after the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show a very distinct behaviour in the memory of the four metals before and during the crisis. While there is a moderate persistence in the full sample and in the pre-COVID-19 sub-period for the four metals, this effect vanishes after the crisis outburst. Positive asymmetric effects are also found in gold and silver volatilities, which intensify during COVID-19 phase. We ascribe this phenomenon to the hedge/safe-haven properties of these metals. By contrast, a diverse pattern is observed in the palladium and platinum volatilities, which display negative asymmetries before the pandemic, in tandem of financial markets. After the crisis, these metals show mixed evidence. Moreover, we argue that COVID-19 significantly affects the volatility of precious metals.},

As scientific, technological, and demographic changes make health care a much more complex service to deliver, efforts to anticipate, avoid, and correct unintended consequences become more crucial. Using narrative examples and an extensive review of the data and the literature, we explore these efforts in four domains of U.S. health care: (1) the increasingly widespread, often challenging use of electronic health records; (2) the threat to the patient-clinician relationship from a greater, sometimes narrow emphasis on productivity metrics; (3) the culture of medicine’s frequently misguided prioritizing of treatment over true healing; and (4) the overreliance on family caregivers who are often poorly prepared to care for the seriously ill. We then apply lessons from health care’s unintended consequences to non-health-care services and suggest opportunities for service researchers to contribute to improving health care delivery, a service that all of us need.},

On the other hand, the growth of the energy-source heterogeneity in mobile clouds is an emerging challenge according to the energy saving problem in mobile nodes. In order to mobile cloud service composition as an NP-Hard problem, an efficient selection method should be taken by problem using optimal energy-aware methods that can extend the deployment and interoperability of mobile cloud components. Also, an energy-aware service composition mechanism is required to preserve high energy saving scenarios for mobile cloud components. In this paper, an energy-aware mechanism is applied to optimize mobile cloud service composition using a hybrid Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (SFGA). Experimental results capture that the proposed mechanism improves the feasibility of the service composition with minimum energy consumption, response time, and cost for mobile cloud components against some current algorithms.},

   abstract = {The rapid development of smartphone technology and the Internet services in mobile devices facilitates easy access to online social networking (OSN) sites anytime, anywhere. At the same time, this allures the adversaries to exploit the OSNs as a soft target for easy execution of various attacks that can quickly spread to a large number of users. In distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, an adversary aims to overwhelm the normal traffic of a targeted server with a flood of fake login messages so that the associated Internet service or website turns inoperable. In this paper, we propose a secure and lightweight authentication scheme (PRDoS) that resists DDoS and other security attacks in mobile OSN environments. We provide a multi-faceted solution towards the remedy of DDoS attacks in the OSN environment. After a certain threshold, the scheme discards further user login attempts and blocks an adversary who intends to overload the network server. We use the pre-loaded shadow identity and emergency key pairs, and a key-refilling strategy that rebuilds the essential synchronization between a blocked naive user and the OSN server. This technique restores the intended un-linkability property of the protocol. Using NS3 simulation, we study the impact of DDoS attackers on network throughput and network delay. Moreover, we validate and compare the proposed scheme against state-of-the-art solutions using the real attacks and benign datasets. We use the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) DoS dataset 2017, which is generated by capturing the normal and DoS attack packets separately with subsequent pre-processed for testing. We also use the machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution in a practical attack detection scenario. We observe that these algorithms provide 97.05%, 95.48%, and 96.6% DDoS attack detection accuracy, respectively.},

Recent research has indicated that radio-logical images carry essential information about the COVID-19 virus. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) assisted automated detection of lung infections may serve as a potential diagnostic tool. It can be augmented with conventional medical tests for tackling COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting COVID-19 and pneumonia using chest X-ray images. The proposed method can be described as a three-step process. The first step includes the segmentation of the raw X-ray images using the conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) for obtaining the lung images. In the second step, we feed the segmented lung images into a novel pipeline combining key points extraction methods and trained deep neural networks (DNN) for extraction of discriminatory features. Several machine learning (ML) models are employed to classify COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal lung images in the final step. A comparative analysis of the classification performance is carried out among the different proposed architectures combining DNNs, key point extraction methods, and ML models. We have achieved the highest testing classification accuracy of 96.6% using the VGG-19 model associated with the binary robust invariant scalable key-points (BRISK) algorithm.

This paper aims to identify how risk tolerance and vaccination rates impact the rate at which a population can return to pre-pandemic contact behavior. To this end, we developed a novel mathematical model and we used techniques from feedback control to inform data-driven decision-making. We use this model to identify optimal levels of NPIs across geographical regions in order to guarantee that hospitalizations will not exceed given risk tolerance thresholds. Results are shown for the state of Colorado, United States, and they suggest that: coordination in decision-making across regions is essential to maintain the daily number of hospitalizations below the desired limits; increasing risk tolerance can decrease the number of days required to discontinue NPIs, at the cost of an increased number of deaths; and if vaccination uptake is less than 70%, at most levels of risk tolerance, return to pre-pandemic contact behaviors before the early months of 2022 may newly jeopardize the healthcare system. The sooner we can acquire population-level vaccination of greater than 70%, the sooner we can safely return to pre-pandemic behaviors.},

In this context, predicting cattle weights supports the decision making process to optimize the beef cattle supply chain animals and improving feed efficiency. Current body weight analyses are typically performed using predetermined models based on a set of differential equations (e.g. Davis Growth model), however they are not easily adaptable to accept new influencing variables made available in the current technological scenario. This study, proposes two fully adaptable approaches to build up models and forecast cattle body weights while considering related variables (e.g. temperature, atmospheric pressure, global radiation, wind speed, air humidity and dry matter intake (DMI). Our approaches explore two complementary scientific branches: (i) Stochastic Processes, where we employ the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seazonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models only on the variable weight; and, (ii) Deterministic Dynamical Systems, with reconstruct at multidimensional spaces representing the relationships among between daily body weights while being influenced by climatic, management and diet variables. Takens’ embeded theorem was used to represent phase spaces, which work as input for a weights regression model based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) – Artificial Neural Network (ANN) base. A dataset comprising 71 Nelore (Bos indicus) cattle were used in this study and the leave-one-out was used as a cross-validation strategy.

MDDL results for 14,21 and 28 days of prediction were, respectively, for MLP: 0.2216,0.3947 and 0.0025 (with 5 hidden layer neurons). For ARIMA, MDDL results were 0.8763,0.9494 and 0.8299 for 14,21 and 28 days of prediction horizon, respectively; and for SARIMA 0.5912,0.5614 and 0.4884 for 14,21 and 28 days of prediction horizon, respectively. This study demonstrates that by integrating different data sources in a deterministic model, one can predict meat production, surpassing the ARIMA and SARIMA models. Further studies on decomposition analyses to support the individual modeling of animals based on stochastic and deterministic influences are warranted.},

   abstract = {Introduction: There is limited access to life-saving antenatal ultrasound in rural and low-resource settings largely due to shortages in skilled staff. Studies have shown healthcare practitioners can be upskilled in PoCUS through focused training, offering a viable solution to this deficit. However, standards for training and competency assessment are unclear and regulation surrounding practice is lacking. We aimed to review published literature examining antenatal PoCUS training programs, comparing teaching approaches and study methodologies. Methods: A search of electronic databases EMBASE, MEDLINE and Google Scholar was conducted. Original research articles evaluating antenatal PoCUS training of healthcare professionals worldwide were identified for analysis. Articles with limited detail on the PoCUS training intervention and those describing comprehensive diagnostic training programs were excluded. Evaluations were compared against the Kirkpatrick Evaluation Framework (KEF). Results: Twenty-seven studies were included from an initial search result of 484 articles. There was considerable heterogeneity between the PoCUS training programs described. Course duration ranged from 3 hours to 2 years, with 11 of the 27 studies delivering obstetric-exclusive content. 44% trained multidisciplinary groups of health professionals. Long-term follow-up training and skills assessments were lacking in over half of the reviewed studies. Study quality and reporting detail varied, but overall beneficial outcomes were reported with 3/4s of the studies reaching upper KEF levels 3 and 4. Conclusion: PoCUS performed by upskilled healthcare professionals offers an attractive solution to the problem of inequitable access to antenatal ultrasound. A review of available literature highlighted a paucity of comparable high-quality studies needed to establish a stronger evidence base for antenatal PoCUS, and a need to standardise training and competency assessment. This review may inform educators, researchers and policy-makers on existing training formats and methodologies to assist in establishing best practice antenatal PoCUS training methods for safe service delivery by remote healthcare professionals.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world socially and economically changing behaviors towards medical facilities, public gatherings, workplaces, and education. Educational institutes have been shutdown sporadically across the globe forcing teachers and students to adopt distance learning techniques. Due to the closure of educational institutes, work and learn from home methods have burdened the network resources and considerably decreased a viewer’s Quality of Experience (QoE). The situation calls for innovative techniques to handle the surging load of video traffic on cellular networks. In the scenario of distance learning, there is ample opportunity to realize multi-cast delivery instead of a conventional unicast. However, the existing 5G architecture does not support service-less multi-cast. In this article, we advance the case of Virtual Network Function (VNF) based service-less architecture for video multicast. Multicasting a video session for distance learning significantly lowers the burden on core and Radio Access Networks (RAN) as demonstrated by evaluation over a real-world dataset. We debate the role of Edge Intelligence (EI) for enabling multicast and edge caching for distance learning to complement the performance of the proposed VNF architecture. EI offers the determination of users that are part of a multicast session based on location, session, and cell information. Moreover, user preferences and network’s contextual information can differentiate between live and cached access patterns optimizing edge caching decisions. While exploring the opportunities of EI-enabled distance learning, we demonstrate a significant reduction in network operator resource utilization and an increase in user QoE for VNF based multicast transmission.},

By constructing a synthetic control group that reproduces pre-lockdown trajectory of mobility of the treated provinces and that accommodates staggered adoption, the difference between the counterfactual and actual mobility of treated provinces is assessed in the post-lockdown period. The analysis shows that in the short-run following the onset of lockdowns, outdoor mobility would have been about 17 to 53 percentage points higher on average in the absence of lockdowns, depending on social distancing measure. On the other hand, residential mobility would have been about 12 percentage points lower in the absence of lockdowns. The findings are corroborated using interactive fixed-effects and matrix completion counterfactuals that accommodate staggered adoption and treatment reversals.},

   abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic suppression policies (i.e. containment measures or lockdowns) on labor supply, capital accumulation, and so the economic growth. We merge an epidemic SIS population model and a Solow’s type growth model, i.e. we propose a fusion between economics and epidemiology. We show the creation and the destruction of economic growth equilibria driven by the suppression policies and by the severity of the disease. The dynamic stability properties of the equilibria are mainly determined by (i) the stringency of the suppression policies, (ii) the proportion of infected workers, (iii) the recovery rate of workers, and (iv) the economy’s saving rate. Thus, economies can fall into the stable equilibrium of the poverty trap if the propensity to save is low and the economic policies that reduce the spread of infection are severe enough with high levels of infection and low rates of illness recovery. Otherwise, with high savings rates and if the suppression policies perform in such a way that infection levels are low and recovery rates are high, then the economies converge towards the equilibrium of high economic growth with capital accumulation. The scenario is rather complex since there is a multiplicity of equilibria such that economies can be in one scenario or another, characterized by stability or (structural) instability, i.e. bifurcation paths. Numerical simulations corroborate our results.},

   abstract = {Caffeine is the world’s most popular stimulant and is consumed daily by a significant portion of the world’s population through coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. Consumers often shop online and in physical stores immediately after or while consuming caffeine. This is further facilitated by the increasing prevalence of coffee shops and also with some retail stores having in-store coffee bars and offering complimentary caffeinated beverages. This research examines how caffeine consumption before shopping influences purchase behavior. The results of a series of experiments conducted in the field (at multiple retail stores across different countries) and in the lab show that consuming a caffeinated (vs. non-caffeinated) beverage before shopping enhances impulsivity in terms of higher number of items purchased and higher spending. This effect is stronger for “high hedonic” products and attenuated for “low hedonic” products. These findings are important for managers to understand how a seemingly unrelated behavior (i.e., caffeine consumption) in and/or around the store affects spending. From a consumer perspective, while moderate amounts of caffeine consumption have positive health benefits, there can be unintended negative financial consequences of caffeine intake on spending. Hence, consumers trying to control impulsive spending should avoid consuming caffeinated beverages before shopping.},

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) like lockdowns and curfews have been deployed by affected countries for controlling the spread of infections. In this paper, we develop a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) epidemic model for computing the optimal sequence of NPIs over a planning horizon, considering shortages in doctors and hospital beds, under three different lockdown scenarios. We analyse two strategies - centralised (homogeneous decisions at the national level) and decentralised (decisions differentiated across regions), for two objectives separately - minimization of infections and deaths, using actual pandemic data of France. We linearize the quadratic constraints and objective functions in the MINLP model and convert it to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. A major result that we show analytically is that under the epidemic model used, the optimal sequence of NPIs always follows a decreasing severity pattern. Using this property, we further simplify the MILP model into an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model, reducing computational time up to 99%. Our numerical results show that a decentralised strategy is more effective in controlling infections for a given severity budget, yielding up to 20% lesser infections, 15% lesser deaths and 60% lesser shortages in healthcare resources. These results hold without considering logistics aspects and for a given level of compliance of the population.},

Emanating from these data, an organizing meta-framework is advanced (D3: design, delegate, and deploy). Leveraging this D3 framework, a comprehensive overview of several dimensions of the literature is provided, and key insights for each framework dimension are presented. Based on this overview, implications for whether, how, and when to integrate social robots in practice and a comprehensive future research agenda are developed.},

Multiple signatures of varying size, complexity, and target populations have been described. However, there is little information to indicate how the performance of various published signatures compare to one another. Methods: This systematic comparison of host gene expression signatures evaluated the performance of 28 signatures, validating them in 4589 subjects from 51 publicly available datasets. Thirteen COVID-specific datasets with 1416 subjects were included in a separate analysis. Individual signature performance was evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) value. Overall signature performance was evaluated using median AUCs and accuracies. Results: Signature performance varied widely, with median AUCs ranging from 0.55 to 0.96 for bacterial classification and 0.69–0.97 for viral classification. Signature size varied (1–398 genes), with smaller signatures generally performing more poorly (P < 0.04). Viral infection was easier to diagnose than bacterial infection (84% vs. 79% overall accuracy, respectively; P <.001). Host gene expression classifiers performed more poorly in some pediatric populations (3 months–1 year and 2–11 years) compared to the adult population for both bacterial infection (73% and 70% vs. 82%, respectively; P <.001) and viral infection (80% and 79% vs. 88%, respectively; P <.001). We did not observe classification differences based on illness severity as defined by ICU admission for bacterial or viral infections. The median AUC across all signatures for COVID-19 classification was 0.80 compared to 0.83 for viral classification in the same datasets. Conclusions: In this systematic comparison of 28 host gene expression signatures, we observed differences based on a signature’s size and characteristics of the validation population, including age and infection type. However, populations used for signature discovery did not impact performance, underscoring the redundancy among many of these signatures. Furthermore, differential performance in specific populations may only be observable through this type of large-scale validation.},

Various state institutions, including education, law enforcement, and healthcare, increasingly rely on technical components, such as automated decision-making systems, e-government systems, and other digital tools to provide cheap, efficient public services, and supposedly fair, transparent, disinterested, and accountable public administration. The increased interest in various blockchain-based solutions from central bank digital currencies, via tokenized educational credentials, and distributed ledger-based land registries to self-sovereign identities is the latest, still mostly unwritten chapter in a long history of standardized, objectified, automated, technocratic, and technologized public administration. The rapid, (often) unplanned, and uncontrolled technologization of public services (as happened in the hasty adoption of distance-learning and teleconferencing systems during Corona Virus Disease (COVID) lockdowns) raises complex questions about the use of novel technological components, which may or may not be ultimately adequate for the task for which they are used. The question whether we can trust the technical infrastructures the public sector uses when providing public services is a central concern in an age where trust in government is declining: If the government’s artificial intelligence system that detects welfare fraud fails, the public’s confidence in the government is ultimately hit. In this paper, we provide a critical assessment of how the use of potentially untrustworthy (private) technological systems including blockchain-based systems in the public sector may affect trust in government. We then propose several policy options to protect the trust in government even if some of their technological components prove fundamentally untrustworthy.},

   abstract = {The public health crisis caused by the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has drastically changed our lifestyle in virtually all contexts around the world. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly airborne, transmitted by the salivary droplets produced when infected people cough or sneeze. In addition, diarrhea symptoms and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in feces suggest a fecal–oral route of contagion. Currently, the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis has surpassed the availability of PCR and immunodetection probes and has prompted the development of other diagnostic alternatives. In this context, mass spectrometry (MS) represents a mature, robust alternative platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other human viruses. This possibility has raised great interest worldwide. Therefore, it is time for the global application of MS as a feasible option for detecting SARS-CoV-2, not only in human fluids, but also in other matrices such as foods and wastewater. This review covers the most relevant established methods for MS-based SARS-CoV-2 detection and discusses the future application of these tools in different matrices. Significance: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the pros and cons of currently available PCR and immunodetection tools. The great concern over the infective potential of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles that can persist for several hours on different surfaces under various conditions further evidenced the need for reliable alternatives and high-throughput methods to meet the needs for mass detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this context, MS-based proteomics emerging from fundamental studies in life science can offer a robust option for SARS-CoV-2 detection in human fluids and other matrices. In addition, the substantial efforts towards detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinal samples, position MS to support the detection of this virus in different matrices such as the surfaces of the packing food process, frozen foods, and wastewaters. Proteomics and mass spectrometry are, therefore, well positioned to play a role in the epidemiological control of COVID-19 and other future diseases. We are currently witnessing the opportunity to generate technologies to overcome prolonged pandemics for the first time in human history.},

   abstract = {When performing symbolic regression using genetic programming, overfitting and bloat can negatively impact generalizability and interpretability of the resulting equations as well as increase computation times. A Bayesian fitness metric is introduced and its impact on bloat and overfitting during population evolution is studied and compared to common alternatives in the literature. The proposed approach was found to be more robust to noise and data sparsity in numerical experiments, guiding evolution to a level of complexity appropriate to the dataset. Further evolution of the population resulted not in overfitting or bloat, but rather in slight simplifications in model form. The ability to identify an equation of complexity appropriate to the scale of noise in the training data was also demonstrated. In general, the Bayesian model selection algorithm was shown to be an effective means of regularization which resulted in less bloat and overfitting when any amount of noise was present in the training data.The efficacy of a Genetic Programming (GP) [1] solution is often characterized by its (1) fitness, i.e. ability to perform a training task, (2) complexity, and (3) generalizability, i.e. ability to perform its task in an unseen scenario. Bloat is a common phenomenon for GP in which continued training results in significant increases in complexity with minimal improvements in fitness. There are several theories for the prevalence of bloat in GP which postulate possible evolutionary benefits of bloat [2]; however, for most practical purposes bloat is a hindrance rather than a benefit. For example, bloated solutions are less interpretable and more computationally expensive. Overfitting is another common phenomena in GP and the broader machine learning field. Overfitting occurs when continued training results in better fitness but reduced generalizability.},

Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the staffing needs for registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) at PHC services using the WISN method. Methods: The Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) methodology was applied at 13 Primary Care Units (PCU) located in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. It included 87 RNs and 174 LPNs, and used data from 2017 to 2019. Results: The WISN results found that RNs were under high workload pressure at 10 PCUs (77%) in 2017 and 2018, with a decrease to 8 PCUs (61%) in 2019. For LPNs, high workload pressure increased from 2 PCUs (15%) in 2017 to 13 PCUs (100%) in 2018, with a decrease to 11 (85%) in 2019. Conclusion: The assessment of staffing needs for RNs and LPNs at the PCUs included in the study identified a consistent deficit in the number of professionals, and high workload pressure in most services throughout the study period.},

   abstract = {Stroke ranks among the leading causes for morbidity and mortality worldwide. New and continuously improving treatment options such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy have revolutionized acute stroke treatment in recent years. Following modern rhythms, the next revolution might well be the strategic use of the steadily increasing amounts of patient-related data for generating models enabling individualized outcome predictions. Milestones have already been achieved in several health care domains, as big data and artificial intelligence have entered everyday life. The aim of this review is to synoptically illustrate and discuss how artificial intelligence approaches may help to compute single-patient predictions in stroke outcome research in the acute, subacute and chronic stage. We will present approaches considering demographic, clinical and electrophysiological data, as well as data originating from various imaging modalities and combinations thereof. We will outline their advantages, disadvantages, their potential pitfalls and the promises they hold with a special focus on a clinical audience. Throughout the review we will highlight methodological aspects of novel machine-learning approaches as they are particularly crucial to realize precision medicine. We will finally provide an outlook on how artificial intelligence approaches might contribute to enhancing favourable outcomes after stroke.},

   abstract = {<p>Machine learning systems are making considerable inroads in society owing to their ability to recognize and predict patterns. However, the decision-making logic of some widely used machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, is characterized by opacity, thereby rendering them exceedingly difficult for humans to understand and explain and, as a result, potentially risky to use. Considering the importance of addressing this opacity, this paper calls for research that studies empirically and theoretically how machine learning experts and users seek to attain machine learning explainability. Focusing on automated trading, we take steps in this direction by analyzing a trading firm’s quest for explaining its deep neural network system’s actionable predictions. We demonstrate that this explainability effort involves a particular form of human–machine interaction that contains both anthropomorphic and technomorphic elements. We discuss this attempt to attain machine learning explainability in light of reflections on cross-species companionship and consider it an example of human–machine companionship.</p>},

Therefore, the primary aim of our study was to report the death (case fatality rate) from SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazilian hospitalized patients with DS from 03 January 2020 to 04 April 2021. The secondary objectives were (i) to compare the features of patients with DS and positive for COVID-19 (G1) to those with DS and with a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) from other etiological factors (G2) to tease apart the unique influence of COVID-19, and (ii) to compare the features of patients with DS and positive for COVID-19 to those without DS, but positive for COVID-19 (G3) to tease apart the unique influence of DS. We obtained the markers for demographic profile, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and the clinical features for SARI evolution during hospitalization in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil from a Brazilian open-access database. The data were compared between (i) G1 [1619 (0.4%) patients] and G2 [1431 (0.4%) patients]; and between (ii) G1 and G3 [222,181 (64.8%) patients]. The case fatality rate was higher in patients with DS and COVID-19 (G1: 39.2%), followed by individuals from G2 (18.1%) and G3 (14.0%). Patients from G1, when compared to G2, were older (≥ 25 years of age), presented more clinical symptoms related to severe illness and comorbidities, needed intensive care unit (ICU) treatment and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) more frequently, and presented a nearly two fold-increased chance of death (OR = 2.92 [95% CI 2.44-3.50]). Patients from G1, when compared to G3, were younger (< 24 years of age), more prone to nosocomial infection, presented an increased chance for clinical symptoms related to a more severe illness; frequently needed ICU treatment, and invasive and non-invasive MV, and raised almost a three fold-increased chance of death (OR = 3.96 [95% CI 3.60-4.41]). The high case fatality rate in G1 was associated with older age (≥ 25 years of age), presence of clinical symptoms, and comorbidities, such as obesity, related to a more severe clinical condition. Unvaccinated patients with DS affected by COVID-19 had a high case fatality rate, and these patients had a different profile for comorbidities, clinical symptoms, and treatment (such as the need for ICU and MV) when compared with other study populations.},

   abstract = {Background: Clinical practice guidelines recommend that adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) sit less and move more throughout the day. The 18-month OPTIMISE Your Health Clinical Trial was developed to support desk-based workers with T2D achieve these recommendations. The two-arm protocol consists of an intervention and control arms. The intervention arm receives 6 months health coaching, a sit-stand desktop workstation and an activity tracker, followed by 6 months of text message support, then 6 months maintenance. The control arm receives a delayed modified intervention after 12 months of usual care. This paper describes the methods of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, compared to a delayed intervention control. Methods: This is a two-arm RCT being conducted in Melbourne, Australia. Desk-based workers (≥0.8 full-time equivalent) aged 35–65 years, ambulatory, and with T2D and managed glycaemic control (6.5–10.0% HbA1c), are randomised to the multicomponent intervention (target n = 125) or delayed-intervention control (target n = 125) conditions. All intervention participants receive 6 months of tailored health coaching assisting them to “sit less” and “move more” at work and throughout the day, supported by a sit-stand desktop workstation and an activity tracker (Fitbit). Participants receive text message-based extended care for a further 6-months (6–12 months) followed by 6-months of non-contact (12–18 months: maintenance). Delayed intervention occurs at 12–18 months for the control arm. Assessments are undertaken at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 15 and 18-months. Primary outcomes are activPAL-measured sitting time (h/16 h day), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c; %, mmol/mol) and, cognitive function measures (visual learning and new memory; Paired Associates Learning Total Errors [adjusted]). Secondary, exploratory, and process outcomes will also be collected throughout the trial. Discussion: The OPTIMISE Your Health trial will provide unique insights into the benefits of an intervention aimed at sitting less and moving more in desk-bound office workers with T2D, with outcomes relevant to glycaemic control, and to cardiometabolic and brain health. Findings will contribute new insights to add to the evidence base on initiating and maintaining behaviour change with clinical populations and inform practice in diabetes management.

   abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has emphasized the role of educational management information systems (EMIS) for quality management (QM) in higher education, and set new directions for post-pandemic studies. Successful implementation of QM processes depends largely on managers' perceptions about quality and educational technology. However, higher education managers’ profiles regarding these quality perceptions and their EMIS acceptance have been insufficiently investigated so far. In response to this research gap, we identified such profiles based on a quantitative survey of N = 70 managers from Chilean higher education institutions during the Covid-19 pandemic. A cluster analysis revealed three distinct manager types: “Elders” (oldest participants, almost equally distributed across positions, with least frequent EMIS access, moderate EMIS acceptance, and highest QM perceptions), “Mediators” (in operational and middle-management positions, with moderately frequent access to EMIS, and lowest EMIS acceptance and QM perceptions), and “Working Bees” (younger females in operational positions, with most frequent EMIS access, highest EMIS acceptance, and moderate QM perceptions). Knowledge of these profiles may enable customized training in the recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic.},

The pandemic has exacerbated these adverse effects and reveals the critical need to put in place policies that can safeguard and sustain trade flows in agricultural products. For the vast majority of countries, food security cannot be guaranteed by domestic production alone. If certain crops are domestically untenable or yields are temporarily poor, imports are essential. Additionally, exports of agricultural products provide a major source of income for some of the poorest people around the world.

These errors are challenging to prevent or correct as they build over time and thus are only visible long after the actions that caused them. As a result, existing work in extrusion additive manufacturing has attempted warp detection but not correction or prevention. We report a hybrid approach combining deep learning, computer vision, and expert heuristics to correct or prevent warp. We train a deep convolutional neural network using diverse labelled images to recognise warp in real-time. We compute five metrics from detection candidates to predict the severity of warp deformation and proportionately update print settings. This enables the first demonstration of automated warp detection and correction both during printing and for future prints.},

   abstract = {Background Estimating the transmissibility of infectious diseases is key to inform situational awareness and for response planning. Several methods tend to overestimate the basic (R_0) and effective (R_t) reproduction numbers during the initial phases of an epidemic. The reasons driving the observed bias are unknown. In this work we explore the impact of incomplete observations and underreporting of the first generations of infections during the initial epidemic phase. Methods We propose a debiasing procedure which utilises a linear exponential growth model to infer unobserved initial generations of infections and apply it to EpiEstim. We assess the performance of our adjustment using simulated data, considering different levels of transmissibility and reporting rates. We also apply the proposed correction to reported SARS-CoV-2 incidence data reported in Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Results In all simulation scenarios, our adjustment outperforms the original EpiEstim method. The proposed correction reduces the systematic bias and the quantification of uncertainty is more precise, as better coverage of the true R_0 values is achieved with tighter credible intervals. When applied to real world data, the proposed adjustment produces basic reproduction number estimates which closely match the estimates obtained in other studies while making use of a minimal amount of data. Conclusions The proposed adjustment refines the reproduction number estimates obtained with the current EpiEstim implementation by producing improved, more precise estimates earlier than with the original method.

   abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Gamma variant of concern has spread rapidly across Brazil since late 2020, causing substantial infection and death waves. Here we used individual-level patient records after hospitalization with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 20 January 2020 and 26 July 2021 to document temporary, sweeping shocks in hospital fatality rates that followed the spread of Gamma across 14 state capitals, during which typically more than half of hospitalized patients aged 70 years and older died. We show that such extensive shocks in COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rates also existed before the detection of Gamma. Using a Bayesian fatality rate model, we found that the geographic and temporal fluctuations in Brazil’s COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rates were primarily associated with geographic inequities and shortages in healthcare capacity. We estimate that approximately half of the COVID-19 deaths in hospitals in the 14 cities could have been avoided without pre-pandemic geographic inequities and without pandemic healthcare pressure. Our results suggest that investments in healthcare resources, healthcare optimization and pandemic preparedness are critical to minimize population-wide mortality and morbidity caused by highly transmissible and deadly pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, especially in low- and middle-income countries.},

   abstract = {Objective: Supporting public health research and the public's situational awareness during a pandemic requires continuous dissemination of infectious disease surveillance data. Legislation, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and recent state-level regulations, permits sharing deidentified person-level data; however, current deidentification approaches are limited. Namely, they are inefficient, relying on retrospective disclosure risk assessments, and do not flex with changes in infection rates or population demographics over time. In this paper, we introduce a framework to dynamically adapt deidentification for near-real time sharing of person-level surveillance data. Materials and Methods: The framework leverages a simulation mechanism, capable of application at any geographic level, to forecast the reidentification risk of sharing the data under a wide range of generalization policies. The estimates inform weekly, prospective policy selection to maintain the proportion of records corresponding to a group size less than 11 (PK11) at or below 0.1. Fixing the policy at the start of each week facilitates timely dataset updates and supports sharing granular date information. We use August 2020 through October 2021 case data from Johns Hopkins University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in maintaining the PK11 threshold of 0.01. Results: When sharing COVID-19 county-level case data across all US counties, the framework's approach meets the threshold for 96.2% of daily data releases, while a policy based on current deidentification techniques meets the threshold for 32.3%. Conclusion: Periodically adapting the data publication policies preserves privacy while enhancing public health utility through timely updates and sharing epidemiologically critical features.},

   abstract = {Biodiversity is in decline and predicting species diversity is critically important if current trends are to be reversed. Tree species richness (TSR), the number of distinct tree species in an ecological community, has long been a key measure of biodiversity, however, accurately modeling TSR is critical to better predicting its spatially heterogeneous responses to the changing environment and to forecasting TSR under future climate scenarios. This dissertation takes a holistic approach to improve TSR modeling with 1) advanced and more interpretable machine learning techniques, 2) to extend predictors to anthropogenic factors, and 3) to leverage open-source online tree occurrences for TSR estimates in the continental United States. The machine learning (ML) approaches demonstrated the efficacy of artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest (RF) to predict the spatial patterns of TSR examined by improved accuracy and less spatially clustered TSR residuals. In addition, the Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) approach, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), revealed the important contribution of forest area and several precipitation-related covariates as well as interaction effects among predictors to TSR. It highlighted the significance of conservation efforts of forest areas and importance of understanding precipitation-related stresses for preserving TSR. Landscape metrics as a new predictor group in XGBoost ML model indicated that landscape heterogeneity are relevant covariates for TSR. The most important landscape metrics are concerning shape and size of forest (core) area. Forest communities with large forest (core) areas of simple geometric shapes and connected forest patches are associated with a larger TSR. Lastly, tree occurrence records from the open-source databases of GBIF and BIEN present various quality and spatial coverage for the continental U.S. A series of quality checks were required to ensure the integration of GBIF and BIEN database with FIA. They showed great potential in predicting TSR estimates with increased spatial coverage and inclusiveness of tree species. This dissertation contributes to improve modeling and prediction of tree diversity while probing into the non-linear and complex interactions that exist between the multitudinous variables affecting tree diversity.},

   abstract = {<h2>Summary</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>The health risks associated with moderate alcohol consumption continue to be debated. Small amounts of alcohol might lower the risk of some health outcomes but increase the risk of others, suggesting that the overall risk depends, in part, on background disease rates, which vary by region, age, sex, and year.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>For this analysis, we constructed burden-weighted dose–response relative risk curves across 22 health outcomes to estimate the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) and non-drinker equivalence (NDE), the consumption level at which the health risk is equivalent to that of a non-drinker, using disease rates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020 for 21 regions, including 204 countries and territories, by 5-year age group, sex, and year for individuals aged 15–95 years and older from 1990 to 2020. Based on the NDE, we quantified the population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>The burden-weighted relative risk curves for alcohol use varied by region and age. Among individuals aged 15–39 years in 2020, the TMREL varied between 0 (95% uncertainty interval 0–0) and 0·603 (0·400–1·00) standard drinks per day, and the NDE varied between 0·002 (0–0) and 1·75 (0·698–4·30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals aged 40 years and older, the burden-weighted relative risk curve was J-shaped for all regions, with a 2020 TMREL that ranged from 0·114 (0–0·403) to 1·87 (0·500–3·30) standard drinks per day and an NDE that ranged between 0·193 (0–0·900) and 6·94 (3·40–8·30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals consuming harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020, 59·1% (54·3–65·4) were aged 15–39 years and 76·9% (73·0–81·3) were male.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>There is strong evidence to support recommendations on alcohol consumption varying by age and location. Stronger interventions, particularly those tailored towards younger individuals, are needed to reduce the substantial global health loss attributable to alcohol.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>},

   abstract = {T cell recognition of a cognate peptide–major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) presented on the surface of infected or malignant cells is of the utmost importance for mediating robust and long-term immune responses. Accurate predictions of cognate pMHC targets for T cell receptors would greatly facilitate identification of vaccine targets for both pathogenic diseases and personalized cancer immunotherapies. Predicting immunogenic peptides therefore has been at the center of intensive research for the past decades but has proven challenging. Although numerous models have been proposed, performance of these models has not been systematically evaluated and their success rate in predicting epitopes in the context of human pathology has not been measured and compared. In this study, we evaluated the performance of several publicly available models, in identifying immunogenic CD8+ T cell targets in the context of pathogens and cancers. We found that for predicting immunogenic peptides from an emerging virus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, none of the models perform substantially better than random or offer considerable improvement beyond HLA ligand prediction. We also observed suboptimal performance for predicting cancer neoantigens. Through investigation of potential factors associated with ill performance of models, we highlight several data- and model-associated issues. In particular, we observed that cross-HLA variation in the distribution of immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptides in the training data of the models seems to substantially confound the predictions. We additionally compared key parameters associated with immunogenicity between pathogenic peptides and cancer neoantigens and observed evidence for differences in the thresholds of binding affinity and stability, which suggested the need to modulate different features in identifying immunogenic pathogen versus cancer peptides. Overall, we demonstrate that accurate and reliable predictions of immunogenic CD8+ T cell targets remain unsolved; thus, we hope our work will guide users and model developers regarding potential pitfalls and unsettled questions in existing immunogenicity predictors.},

   abstract = {Recent studies demonstrated the vulnerability of control policies learned through deep reinforcement learning against adversarial attacks, raising concerns about the application of such models to risk-sensitive tasks such as autonomous driving. Threat models for these demonstrations are limited to (1) targeted attacks through real-time manipulation of the agent's observation, and (2) untargeted attacks through manipulation of the physical environment. The former assumes full access to the agent's states/observations at all times, while the latter has no control over attack outcomes. This paper investigates the feasibility of targeted attacks through visually learned patterns placed on physical objects in the environment, a threat model that combines the practicality and effectiveness of the existing ones. Through analysis, we demonstrate that a pre-trained policy can be hijacked within a time window, e.g., performing an unintended self-parking, when an adversarial object is present. To enable the attack, we adopt an assumption that the dynamics of both the environment and the agent can be learned by the attacker. Lastly, we empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed attack on different driving scenarios, perform a location robustness test, and study the tradeoff between the attack strength and its effectiveness Code is available at https://github.com/ASU-APG/ Targeted-Physical-Adversarial-Attacks-on-AD},

But climate change, in addition to the high ventilation standards enforced by authorities due to the COVID pandemic, have increased the importance of HVACs worldwide. We propose a machine learning (ML) approach to the challenge of failure detection from incomplete data, consisting of two steps: 1.&nbsp;human-annotation bootstrapping, on a fraction of temperature data, to detect ongoing functional loss and build an artificial ground truth (AGT); 2.&nbsp;failure prediction from digital-data, using the AGT to train an ML model based on failure diagnose codes to foretell functional loss. We exercise our approach in trains of Dutch Railways, showing its implementation, ML-predictive capabilities (the ML model for the AGT can detect HVAC malfunctions online), limitations (we could not foretell failures from our digital data), and discussing its application to other assets.},

   abstract = {This article presents outcomes from a Workshop entitled “Bioarchaeology: Taking Stock and Moving Forward,” which was held at Arizona State University (ASU) on March 6–8, 2020. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the School of Human Evolution and Social Change (ASU), and the Center for Bioarchaeological Research (CBR, ASU), the Workshop's overall goal was to explore reasons why research proposals submitted by bioarchaeologists, both graduate students and established scholars, fared disproportionately poorly within recent NSF Anthropology Program competitions and to offer advice for increasing success. Therefore, this Workshop comprised 43 international scholars and four advanced graduate students with a history of successful grant acquisition, primarily from the United States. Ultimately, we focused on two related aims: (1) best practices for improving research designs and training and (2) evaluating topics of contemporary significance that reverberate through history and beyond as promising trajectories for bioarchaeological research. Among the former were contextual grounding, research question/hypothesis generation, statistical procedures appropriate for small samples and mixed qualitative/quantitative data, the salience of Bayesian methods, and training program content. Topical foci included ethics, social inequality, identity (including intersectionality), climate change, migration, violence, epidemic disease, adaptability/plasticity, the osteological paradox, and the developmental origins of health and disease. Given the profound changes required globally to address decolonization in the 21st century, this concern also entered many formal and informal discussions.},

   abstract = {A self-driving database management system (DBMS) aims to configure, deploy, and optimize almost all aspects of itself automatically without human intervention or guidance. Achieving this high level of automation relies on machine learning (ML) models that predict how a DBMS will behave in different scenarios. This behavior encompasses all DBMS runtime operations, including query execution and maintenance tasks. These ML-based behavior models for a self-driving DBMS require low-level training data about a DBMS's internals. Such training data includes (1) features that describe the workload, environment, and DBMS configuration, and (2) both DBMS- and hardware-level metrics. But it is difficult to collect training data from a DBMS while it is running because it can introduce performance and measurement degradations that hinder the ML models' ability to predict the DBMS's behavior correctly. We present the TScout (TS) framework for collecting training data from self-driving DBMSs. Our framework is an internal approach where developers annotate a DBMS's source code with hooks to monitor the system's behavior. TS then extracts these hooks and generates a kernel-level program (via Linux's BPF) that efficiently captures metrics from multiple sources (e.g., CPU performance counters, memory allocators). TS combines these metrics with internal DBMS state observations, generating training data for behavior models. We integrated TS in a PostgreSQL-compatible DBMS and measured its ability to collect training data for both OLTP and OLAP workloads. Our results show that TS generates training data for a deployed DBMS to train more accurate models than previous methods with only a 7% performance reduction.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the problem of rumours on online social media (OSM) has attracted lots of attention. Researchers have started investigating from two main directions. First is the descriptive analysis of rumours and secondly, proposing techniques to detect (or classify) rumours. In the descriptive line of works, where researchers have tried to analyse rumours using NLP approaches, there isn't much emphasis on psycho-linguistics analyses of social media text. These kinds of analyses on rumour case studies are vital for drawing meaningful conclusions to mitigate misinformation. For our analysis, we explored the PHEME-9 rumour dataset (consisting of 9 events), including source tweets (both rumour and non-rumour categories) and response tweets. We compared the rumour and non-rumour source tweets and then their corresponding reply (response) tweets to understand how they differ linguistically for every incident. Furthermore, we also evaluated if these features can be used for classifying rumour vs. non-rumour tweets through machine learning models. To this end, we employed various classical and ensemble-based approaches. To filter out the highly discriminative psycholinguistic features, we explored the SHAP AI Explainability tool. To summarise, this research contributes by performing an in-depth psycholinguistic analysis of rumours related to various kinds of events.},

The existing studies on Bitcoin price prediction are mainly in two ways: (1) study how economic factors, market and investor sentiment indicators influence Bitcoin price; (2) apply machine learning and artificial neural networks to predict the value of Bitcoin. This paper aims to implement a scenario analysis method to generate various hypothetical events and then determine their effects on the value of Bitcoin price. Scenario analysis is normally used to measure financial risk. In this paper, we propose a method that combines scenario analysis with historical data. We further aim to find the correlations among scenarios and examine the relationship between the significant shocks and Bitcoin prices. Our findings suggest that what-if analysis is a good way to measure the risk exposure of Bitcoin. The method can also be used for worse-scenario analysis to check how Bitcoin performs during crisis periods.},

   abstract = {Purpose: In this scoping review, we examined the international literature on risk-stratified bowel screening to develop recommendations for future research, practice and policy. Methods: Six electronic databases were searched from inception to 18 October 2021: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Forward and backwards citation searches were also undertaken. All relevant literature were included. Results: After de-deduplication, 3,629 records remained. 3,416 were excluded at the title/abstract screening stage. A further 111 were excluded at full-text screening stage. In total, 102 unique studies were included. Results showed that risk-stratified bowel screening programmes can potentially improve diagnostic performance, but there is a lack of information on longer-term outcomes. Risk models do appear to show promise in refining existing risk stratification guidelines but most were not externally validated and less than half achieved good discriminatory power. Risk assessment tools in primary care have the potential for high levels of acceptability and uptake, and therefore, could form an important component of future risk-stratified bowel screening programmes, but sometimes the screening recommendations were not adhered to by the patient or healthcare provider. The review identified important knowledge gaps, most notably in the area of organisation of screening services due to few pilots, and what risk stratification might mean for inequalities. Conclusion: We recommend that future research focuses on what organisational challenges risk-stratified bowel screening may face and a consideration of inequalities in any changes to organised bowel screening programmes.},

   abstract = {In the context of the global coronavirus pandemic, different deep learning solutions for infected subject detection using chest X-ray images have been proposed. However, deep learning models usually need large labelled datasets to be effective. Semi-supervised deep learning is an attractive alternative, where unlabelled data is leveraged to improve the overall model's accuracy. However, in real-world usage settings, an unlabelled dataset might present a different distribution than the labelled dataset (i.e. the labelled dataset was sampled from a target clinic and the unlabelled dataset from a source clinic). This results in a distribution mismatch between the unlabelled and labelled datasets. In this work, we assess the impact of the distribution mismatch between the labelled and the unlabelled datasets, for a semi-supervised model trained with chest X-ray images, for COVID-19 detection. Under strong distribution mismatch conditions, we found an accuracy hit of almost 30%, suggesting that the unlabelled dataset distribution has a strong influence in the behaviour of the model. Therefore, we propose a straightforward approach to diminish the impact of such distribution mismatch. Our proposed method uses a density approximation of the feature space. It is built upon the target dataset to filter out the observations in the source unlabelled dataset that might harm the accuracy of the semi-supervised model. It assumes that a small labelled source dataset is available together with a larger source unlabelled dataset. Our proposed method does not require any model training, it is simple and computationally cheap. We compare our proposed method against two popular state of the art out-of-distribution data detectors, which are also cheap and simple to implement. In our tests, our method yielded accuracy gains of up to 32%, when compared to the previous state of the art methods. The good results yielded by our method leads us to argue in favour for a more data-centric approach to improve model's accuracy. Furthermore, the developed method can be used to measure data effectiveness for semi-supervised deep learning model training.},

   abstract = {Background: This study longitudinally evaluated first-onset major depression rates during the pandemic in Italian adults without any current clinician-diagnosed psychiatric disorder and created a predictive machine learning model (MLM) to evaluate subsequent independent samples. Methods: An online, self-reported survey was released during two pandemic periods (May to June and September to October 2020). Provisional diagnoses of major depressive disorder (PMDD) were determined using a diagnostic algorithm based on the DSM criteria of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to maximize specificity. Gradient-boosted decision trees and the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique created the MLM and estimated each variable's predictive contribution. Results: There were 3532 participants in the study. The final sample included 633 participants in the first wave (FW) survey and 290 in the second (SW). First-onset PMDD was found in 7.4% of FW participants and 7.2% of the SW. The final MLM, trained on the FW, displayed a sensitivity of 76.5% and a specificity of 77.8% when tested on the SW. The main factors identified in the MLM were low resilience, being an undergraduate student, being stressed by pandemic-related conditions, and low satisfaction with usual sleep before the pandemic and support from relatives. Current smoking and taking medication for medical conditions also contributed, albeit to a lesser extent. Limitations: Small sample size; self-report assessment; data covering 2020 only. Conclusions: Rates of first-onset PMDD among Italians during the first phases of the pandemic were considerable. Our MLM displayed a good predictive performance, suggesting potential goals for depression-preventive interventions during public health crises.},

   abstract = {The microclimate in which historical buildings and objects are placed strongly influences the mechanical decay and properties of the constituent materials, especially if they are susceptible to fluctuations of temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH). For this reason, in this work, the attention is focused on the indoor microclimate of an historic building completely made of Scots pine wood: Ringebu Church (Norway). In particular, the indoor RH of Ringebu church has been analyzed by means of the European Standard EN15757, which establishes guidelines on assessing whether the RH fluctuations are risky for the conservation of historic hygroscopic materials (such as wood). However, for conservation purposes, it is useful to further study the entity of the RH fluctuations. In this framework, a novel simple strategy, named Median of Data Strategy (MoDS), for identifying RH drops is here proposed; the new approach, by scanning the RH time series and being tested on several examples, displays potential for better assessing the risk of degradation of wooden assets, objects, and artefacts. Then, based on evidence available in literature, a simple empirical model for computing the levels of hygro-mechanical stress developed due to hygric changes has been described and a novel tool for assessing the climate-induced mechanical risk for wooden structures has been proposed. Finally, a machine learning approach for predicting whether climatic fluctuations may have catastrophic effects on the historical wooden materials is presented as well. The obtained results show that the different proposed approaches may be useful for general assessments on the risk of decay of wooden samples and they open a pathway for future investigations in the fields of fracture mechanics, fatigue behavior and smart timeseries prediction for conservation and preservation purposes.},

Methods: All relevant policies on LG websites were identified and analysed against a framework of 34 recommendations for LG action on food system issues. Results: A total of 13 of 207 (New South Wales 128, Victoria 79) LGs had dedicated food system policies. Most actions on food system issues were in general (non-food specific) policies. Most LGs acted on food safety, sustainable local food production, food waste, drinking water access and food system-related education. Few used economic measures to support the consumption of healthier foods, restricted unhealthy food advertising, developed and implemented dietary guidelines in LG-managed settings or influenced the opening of unhealthy/healthy retail food outlets. Conclusions: LGs undertook a range of actions relevant to creating a healthy, sustainable and equitable food system. Strategic opportunities for LGs include regulating the sale and marketing of unhealthy food and ensuring policy coherence. Implications for public health: LGs can be supported to act further on food system issues, including through ‘joined-up’ state and federal policies. Further research should address how relevant LG policies can be developed, implemented and monitored effectively to address the complex challenges created by contemporary food systems.},

With the ongoing need in the delivery of life-saving cancer treatment, the surgical management of patients with colorectal cancer required prompt significant transformation. The aim of this retrospective study is to report the outcome of a bespoke regional Cancer Hub model in the delivery of elective and essential colorectal cancer surgery, at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. 168 patients underwent colorectal cancer surgery from April 1st to June 30th of 2020. Approximately 75% of patients operated upon underwent colonic resection, of which 47% were left-sided, 34% right-sided and 12% beyond total mesorectal excision surgeries. Around 79% of all resectional surgeries were performed via laparotomy, and the remainder 21%, robotically or laparoscopically. Thirty-day complication rate, for Clavien-Dindo IIIA and above, was 4.2%, and 30-day mortality rate was 0.6%. Re-admission rate, within 30 days post-discharge, was 1.8%, however, no patient developed COVID-19 specific complications post-operatively and up to 28 days post-discharge. The established Cancer Hub offered elective surgical care for patients with colorectal cancer in a centralised, timely and efficient manner, with acceptable post-operative outcomes and no increased risk of contracting COVID-19 during their inpatient stay. We offer a practical model of care that can be used when elective surgery "hubs" for streamlined delivery of elective care needs to be established in an expeditious fashion, either due to the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future pandemics.},

   abstract = {The obesity epidemic shows no signs of abatement. Genetics and overnutrition together with a dramatic decline in physical activity are the alleged main causes for this pandemic. While they undoubtedly represent the main contributors to the obesity problem, they are not able to fully explain all cases and current trends. In this context, a body of knowledge related to exposure to as yet underappreciated obesogenic factors, which can be referred to as the “exposome”, merits detailed analysis. Contrarily to the genome, the “exposome” is subject to a great dynamism and variability, which unfolds throughout the individual’s lifetime. The development of precise ways of capturing the full exposure spectrum of a person is extraordinarily demanding. Data derived from epidemiological studies linking excess weight with elevated ambient temperatures, in utero, and intergenerational effects as well as epigenetics, microorganisms, microbiota, sleep curtailment, and endocrine disruptors, among others, suggests the possibility that they may work alone or synergistically as several alternative putative contributors to this global epidemic. This narrative review reports the available evidence on as yet underappreciated drivers of the obesity epidemic. Broadly based interventions are needed to better identify these drivers at the same time as stimulating reflection on the potential relevance of the “exposome” in the development and perpetuation of the obesity epidemic.},

It is over two years since the first case was announced in China and health care providers are continuing to struggle with this fatal infectious disease in intensive care units and inpatient wards. Meanwhile, the burden of postponed routine medical procedures has become greater as the pandemic has progressed. We believe that establishing separate health care institutions for infected and non-infected patients would provide safer and better quality health care services. The aim of this study is to find the appropriate number and location of dedicated health care institutions which would only treat individuals infected by a pandemic during an outbreak. For this purpose, a decision-making framework including two multi-objective mixed-integer programming models is developed. At the strategic level, the locations of designated pandemic hospitals are optimized. At the tactical level, we determine the locations and operation durations of temporary isolation centers which treat mildly and moderately symptomatic patients. The developed framework provides assessments of the distance that infected patients travel, the routine medical services expected to be disrupted, two-way distances between new facilities (designated pandemic hospitals and isolation centers), and the infection risk in the population. To demonstrate the applicability of the suggested models, we perform a case study for the European side of Istanbul. In the base case, seven designated pandemic hospitals and four isolation centers are established. In sensitivity analyses, 23 cases are analyzed and compared to provide support to decision makers.},

This situation will also affect their academic motivation. This research aimed to test whether the fear of contracting COVID-19 (CoVFC) had a moderating effect on the prediction of preservice teachers’ academic motivation (AMOTV) with their computer self-efficacy perceptions (CSE). With a combined approach, a single model was employed to test the moderating role of CoVFC and the mediating role of Attitudes towards E-Learning (ATEL) in the prediction of preservice teachers’ AMOTV with their CSE. 522 preservice teachers from 21 different branches participated in this research. As a result of the research, the CSE of preservice teachers were determined to predict their AMOTV significantly and positively. The increase in CoVFC was found to have a negative moderating effect on the prediction of AMOTV with the CSE of preservice teachers. Also, ATEL was found to have a partial mediating effect in the relationship between the CSE and AMOTV of preservice teachers.},

The case started when Jong, the senior certified analytics professional, and his team were drafting a proposal presentation on a new franchise approval process to present to Tony, the director of Coffee Refresh. Currently, Coffee Refresh was experiencing a significant delay in approving franchise opening requests. In addition, the current approval process was relied on the appraisal teams’ evaluations, which involved self-judgment as to the accessibility and visibility of the store location in each franchise opening request and a manual count of the potential targeted customers at each location, which impacted how the appraisal teams estimated the expected revenue for each location. During the first meeting with Jong and his team, Tony was frustrated by the current evaluation process, resulting in a significant backlog of requests pending approval, which was far behind the target for its franchise branch expansion strategy. It had also been reported that the branches that opened during the past few years had a relatively low success ratio (losses between 4.8% and 16.5%) and that the rate of branch closures had increased from 2% to 7.5%. Currently, eight franchise opening requests were pending, and Jong had to provide a recommendation for which requests should be approved. Coffee Refresh could approve all of them instantly, approve some of them, or even decline all of them. This was a great opportunity for Jong and his team to revisit the current franchise approval process and to demonstrate how business intelligence systems could improve the request approval process as well as address the issues of the current franchises’ underperformance and the closure rates.},

   abstract = {The tragic pandemic of COVID-19, due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2, has shaken the entire world, and has significantly disrupted health-care systems in many countries. Because of the existing challenges and controversies to testing for COVID-19, improved and cost-effective methods are needed to detect the disease. For this purpose, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a strong forecasting method for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. In this paper, we used a Deep Learning Method (DLM) to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray (CXR) images. Radiographic images are readily available and can be used effectively for COVID-19 detection compared to other expensive and time-consuming pathological tests. We used a dataset of 10,040 samples, of which 2143 had COVID-19, 3674 had pneumonia (but not COVID-19), and 4223 were normal (not COVID-19 or pneumonia). Our model had a detection accuracy of 96.43% and a sensitivity of 93.68%. The area under the ROC curve was 99% for COVID-19, 97% for pneumonia (but not COVID-19 positive), and 98% for normal cases. In conclusion, ML approaches may be used for rapid analysis of CXR images and thus enable radiologists to filter potential candidates in a time-effective manner to detect COVID-19.},

   abstract = {A human monoclonal antibody panel (PD4, PD5, PD7, SC23 and SC29) was isolated from the B cells of convalescent patients and used to examine the S protein in SARS-CoV-2- infected cells. While all five antibodies bound conformational-specific epitopes within SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, only PD5, PD7, and SC23 were able to bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine the S protein RBD in cells infected with the Singapore isolates SARS-CoV-2/0334 and SARS-CoV-2/1302. The RBD-binders exhibited a distinct cytoplasmic staining pattern that was primarily localised within the Golgi complex and was distinct from the diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern exhibited by the non-RBD binders (PD4 and SC29). These data indicated that the S protein adopted a conformation in the Golgi complex that enabled the RBD recognition by the RBD-binders. The RBD-binders also recognised the uncleaved S protein indicating that S protein cleavage was not required for RBD recognition. Electron microscopy indicated high levels of cell-associated virus particles, and multiple cycle virus infection using RBD-binder staining provided evidence for direct cell-to-cell transmission for both isolates. Although similar levels of RBD-binder staining was demonstrated for each isolate, the SARS-CoV-2/1302 exhibited slower rates of cell-to-cell transmission. These data suggest that a conformational change in the S protein occurs during its transit through the Golgi complex that enables RBD recognition by the RBD-binders, and suggests that these antibodies can be used to monitor S protein RBD formation during the early stages of infection.Importance The SARS CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) mediates the attachment of SARS CoV-2 to the host cell. This interaction plays an essential role in initiating virus infection and the S protein RBD is therefore a focus of therapeutic and vaccine interventions. However, new virus variants have emerged with altered biological properties in the RBD that can potentially negate these interventions. Therefore an improved understanding of the biological properties of the RBD in virus-infected cells may offer future therapeutic strategies to mitigate SARS CoV-2 infection. We used physiologically relevant antibodies that were isolated from the B cells of convalescent COVID19 patients to monitor the RBD in cells infected with SARS CoV-2 clinical isolates. These immunological reagents specifically recognise the correctly folded RBD and were used to monitor the appearance of the RBD in SARS CoV-2-infected cells and identified the site where the RDB first appears.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing has played an important role in documenting the emergence of polymorphisms in the viral genome and its continuing evolution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we present data from over 360 patients to characterize the complex sequence diversity of individual infections identified during multiple variant surges (e.g., Alpha and Delta; requiring >= 80% genome coverage and >=100X read depth). Across our survey, we observed significantly increasing SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity during the pandemic and frequent occurrence of multiple biallelic sequence polymorphisms in all infections. This sequence polymorphism shows that SARS-CoV-2 infections are heterogeneous mixtures. Convention for reporting microbial pathogens guides investigators to report a majority consensus sequence. In our study, we found that this approach would under-report at least 79% of the observed sequence variation. As we find that this sequence heterogeneity is efficiently transmitted from donors to recipients, our findings illustrate that infection complexity must be monitored and reported more completely to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission dynamics involving both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Many of the nucleotide changes that would not be reported in a majority consensus sequence have now been observed as lineage defining SNPs in Omicron BA.1 and/or BA.2 variants. This suggests that minority alleles in earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may play an important role in the continuing evolution of new variants of concern.AUTHOR SUMMARY Evolution of the virus causing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with significant transmission surges. With evolution of SARS-CoV-2, evidence has accumulated regarding increased transmissibility of lineages, varying severity of illness, evasion of vaccines and diagnostic tests. Continuous tracking of SARS-CoV-2 lineage evolution distills very large and complex viral sequence data sets down to consensus sequences that report the majority nucleotide at each of over 29,000 positions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observe that this eliminates considerable sequence variation and leads to a significant underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection diversity and transmission complexity. Additionally, concentration on the majority consensus sequence diverts attention from genetic variation that may contribute significantly to the continuing evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.Competing Interest StatementCJD has received research grants from Clorox, Pfizer, and PDI.

   abstract = {The Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) allocates funds to participants for purchase of services. Only one percent of the 89,299 participants spent all of their allocated funds with 85 participants having failed to spend any, meaning that most of the participants were left with unspent funds. The gap between the allocated budget and realised expenditure reflects misallocation of funds. Thus we employ alternative machine learning techniques to estimate budget and close the gap while maintaining the aggregate level of spending. Three experiments are conducted to test the machine learning models in estimating the budget, expenditure and the resulting gap; compare the learning rate between machines and humans; and identify the significant explanatory variables. Results show that machines learn “faster” than humans; machine learning models can improve the efficiency of the NDIS implementation; and significant explanatory variables identified by decision tree models and regression analysis are similar.},

   abstract = {We identify 21 predetermined country-level factors that explain marked variations in weekly COVID-19 morbidity and mortality across 91 countries between January and the end of 2020. Besides factors commonly associated with infectious diseases (e.g., population and tourism activities), we discover a list of country characteristics that shape COVID-19 outcomes. Among demographic–geographic factors, the male-to-female ratio, population density, and urbanization aggravate the severity of COVID-19, while education, temperature, and religious diversity mitigate the impact of the pandemic on morbidity and mortality. For the political-legal dimension, democracy and political corruption are aggravating factors. In contrast, female leadership, the strength of legal systems, and public trust in government significantly reduce infections and deaths. In terms of socio-economic aspects, GDP per capita, income inequality, and happiness (i.e., life satisfaction) lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes. Interestingly, technology advancement increases morbidity but reduces mortality. For healthcare factors, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) experience and healthcare infrastructure help countries perform better in combating the pandemic.},

   abstract = {Objective: After months of lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the US postsecondary institutions implemented different instruction approaches to bring their students back for the Fall 2020 semester. Given public health concerns with reopening campuses, the study evaluated the impact of Fall 2020 college reopenings on COVID-19 transmission within the 632 US university counties. Study design: This was a retrospective and observational study. Methods: Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) models were conducted to investigate the county-level COVID-19 case increases during the first 21 days of Fall 2020. The case increase for each county was estimated by comparing the observed time series (actual daily cases after school reopening) to the BSTS counterfactual time series (predictive daily cases if not reopening during the same time frame). We then used multilevel models to examine the associations between opening approaches (in-person, online, and hybrid) and county-level COVID-19 case increases within 21 and 42 days after classes began. The multigroup comparison between mask and non-mask-required states for these associations were also performed, given that the statewide guidelines might moderate the effects of college opening approaches. Results: More than 80% of our university county sample did not experience a significant case increase in Fall 2020. There were no significant relationships between opening approaches and community transmission in both mask-required and non-mask-required states. Only small metropolitan counties and counties with a non-community college or a higher percentage of student population showed significantly positive associations with the case number increase within the first 21-day period of Fall 2020. For the longer 42-day period, the counties with a higher percentage of the student population showed a significant case increase. Conclusion: The overall findings underscored the outcomes of US higher education reopening efforts when the vaccines were still under development in Fall 2020. For individual county results, we invite the college- and county-level decision-makers to interpret their results using our web application.},

Then, the functional design of the π-cross-dock and the classical one are discussed while highlighting the distinctive features of both configurations. The different cross-docking optimization problems arising from the PI paradigm are then specified at the strategic, tactical and operational decision levels, showing how they differ from the problems already addressed for “traditional” cross-docking platforms.

Psychological distress can be caused directly by the pandemic itself, such as fear of contracting the disease, or by stress from losing jobs due to the disruption of economic activities. In addition, many government measures such as lockdown, unemployment aids, subsidies, or vaccination policy also affect population mood, sentiments, and mental health. This paper utilizes deep-learning-based techniques to extract sentiment, mood, and psychological signals from social media messages and use such aggregate signals to trace population-level mental health. To validate the accuracy of our proposed methods, we cross-check our results with the actual mental illness cases reported by Thailand’s Department of Mental Health and found a high correlation between the predicted mental health signals and the actual mental illness cases.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many frontline employees experienced numerous challenges as most of the places there were full or partial lockdown imposed by the government agencies and the frontline employees could not be able to directly connect with their customers. Not many studies are there which investigated the issue of resource integration, dynamic capabilities, and engineering management abilities of the frontline employees such as technological capability, emotional intelligence, and psychological capability which perceived to influence the frontline employee adaptability and organization performance. In this background, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between frontline employee adaptability and organization performance during COVID-19 pandemic from technological, emotional, and psychological perspectives. With the help of dynamic capability view and different adaptability theories, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually. Later the conceptual model has been validated using partial least square – structural equation modeling technique considering 412 respondents from frontline employees of different organizations in Asia and EMEA. The study found that frontline employees’ dynamic capabilities and engineering management abilities significantly and positively impact employee adaptability which in turn impact the performance of the organization mediating through employee job satisfaction and employee performance.},

   abstract = {Adversarial attacks have been a major deterrent towards the adoption of machine learning models reliably in many safety-critical applications. Structured perturbations introduced to test samples can fool high performing trained neural networks and force errors. We note that one of the key causes that facilitate adversarial attacks, is the curse of dimensionality or the behaviour of the high dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose a machine learning infrastructure that is robust against adversarial attacks. The proposed pipeline uses a parallel pathway to carry out the primary machine learning task as well as identify adversarial samples. We use dimension reduction techniques to project adversarial samples into lower dimensions, thus eliminating adversarial perturbations. The end-to-end system has been tested to provide robustness, through different choices of neural architectures (VGG-19 [1], Inception ResNet v2 [2]), modes of adversarial attacks (FGSM [3] and PGD [4]) and multiple datasets (MNIST [5], CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 [6]). The overall accuracy of the end-to-end system was consistently found to be within a range of 1–2% (2%–4% in worst case scenarios) of what the accuracy would have been without the presence of any adversarial examples. We also show that this robustness is delivered without much compromise in time consumed for inference per sample.},

Despite the depth of scholarly writing on the intimate and inextricable ties between culture and psychological processes, core advancements and definitive positions in psychology have remained elusive. The privileging of a single culturally specific world-view alongside the exclusion of others has seriously hindered the authentic internationalization of psychology. We propose that linkages between culture and psychology need to be visualized as a dialogue between different cultural traditions. In the dialectics between bheda–abheda (difference and non-difference), structural-developmental, dispositional-relational, and social-collective processes will be invoked to develop our arguments for a human-science approach to the study of persons in culture. We argue that it is through the inclusion, rather than suppression, of diverse ideologies that generalizability can be best achieved. This is a call for an audit and reconstruction of psychology and its practices as an international discipline with a roadmap for theory construction and research informed by a cultural psychological approach toward human phenomena.},

   abstract = {Background: Neurosurgical training has been traditionally based on an apprenticeship model. However, restrictions on clinical exposure reduce trainees’ operative experience. Simulation models may allow for a more efficient, feasible, and time-effective acquisition of skills. Our objectives were to use face, content, and construct validity to review the use of simulation models in neurosurgical education. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were queried for eligible studies. After excluding duplicates, 1204 studies were screened. Eighteen studies were included in the final review. Results: Neurosurgical skills assessed included aneurysm clipping (n = 6), craniotomy and burr hole drilling (n = 2), tumour resection (n = 4), and vessel suturing (n = 3). All studies assessed face validity, 11 assessed content, and 6 assessed construct validity. Animal models (n = 5), synthetic models (n = 7), and VR models (n = 6) were assessed. In face validation, all studies rated visual realism favourably, but haptic realism was key limitation. The synthetic models ranked a high median tactile realism (4 out of 5) compared to other models. Assessment of content validity showed positive findings for anatomical and procedural education, but the models provided more benefit to the novice than the experienced group. The cadaver models were perceived to be the most anatomically realistic by study participants. Construct validity showed a statistically significant proficiency increase among the junior group compared to the senior group across all modalities. Conclusion: Our review highlights evidence on the feasibility of implementing simulation models in neurosurgical training. Studies should include predictive validity to assess future skill on an individual on whom the same procedure will be administered. This study shows that future neurosurgical training systems call for surgical simulation and objectively validated models.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Yemen has experienced widespread insecurity since 2014, resulting in large-scale internal displacement. In the absence of reliable vital events registration, we tried to reconstruct the evolution of Yemen's population between June 2014 and September 2021, at subdistrict (administrative level 3) resolution, while accounting for growth and internal migration. Methods: We reconstructed subdistrict-month populations starting from June 2014 WorldPop gridded estimates, as a function of assumed birth and death rates, estimated changes in population density, net internal displacement to and from the subdistrict and assumed overlap between internal displacement and WorldPop trends. Available displacement data from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) project were subjected to extensive cleaning and imputation to resolve missingness, including through machine learning models informed by predictors such as insecurity. We also modelled the evolution of displaced groups before and after assessment points. To represent parameter uncertainty, we complemented the main analysis with sensitivity scenarios. Results: We estimated that Yemen's population rose from about 26.3 M to 31.1 M during the seven-year analysis period, with considerable pattern differences at sub-national level. We found that some 10 to 14 M Yemenis may have been internally displaced during 2015–2016, about five times United Nations estimates. By contrast, we estimated that the internally displaced population had declined to 1–2 M by September 2021. Conclusions: This analysis illustrates approaches to analysing the dynamics of displacement, and the application of different models and data streams to supplement incomplete ground observations. Our findings are subject to limitations related to data quality, model inaccuracy and omission of migration outside Yemen. We recommend adaptations to the DTM project to enable more robust estimation.},

   abstract = {Background: Populations affected by crises (armed conflict, food insecurity, natural disasters) are poorly covered by demographic surveillance. As such, crisis-wide estimation of population mortality is extremely challenging, resulting in a lack of evidence to inform humanitarian response and conflict resolution. Methods: We describe here a ‘small-area estimation’ method to circumvent these data gaps and quantify both total and excess (i.e. crisis-attributable) death rates and tolls, both overall and for granular geographic (e.g. district) and time (e.g. month) strata. The method is based on analysis of data previously collected by national and humanitarian actors, including ground survey observations of mortality, displacement-adjusted population denominators and datasets of variables that may predict the death rate. We describe the six sequential steps required for the method’s implementation and illustrate its recent application in Somalia, South Sudan and northeast Nigeria, based on a generic set of analysis scripts. Results: Descriptive analysis of ground survey data reveals informative patterns, e.g. concerning the contribution of injuries to overall mortality, or household net migration. Despite some data sparsity, for each crisis that we have applied the method to thus far, available predictor data allow the specification of reasonably predictive mixed effects models of crude and under 5 years death rate, validated using cross-validation. Assumptions about values of the predictors in the absence of a crisis provide counterfactual and excess mortality estimates. Conclusions: The method enables retrospective estimation of crisis-attributable mortality with considerable geographic and period stratification, and can therefore contribute to better understanding and historical memorialisation of the public health effects of crises. We discuss key limitations and areas for further development.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability in the United States creating substantial hardships through negative social, financial, and health effects. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) accounted for above half of patients treated in physical therapy (PT) clinics for LBP. However, research shows small benefit from PT in CLBP treatment. Preliminary evidence suggests clinician-level training variables may affect outcomes, but requires further investigation to determine whether patients with CLBP benefit from treatment by providers with post-professional training. This study examined the relationship between clinician training levels and patient-reported outcomes in CLBP treatment. Methods: Physical therapies were surveyed using a large patient outcome assessment system to determine and categorise them by level of post-professional education. To account for the possibility that clinicians with higher levels of training are referred more-complex patients, a machine learning approach was used to identify predictive variables for clinician group, then to construct propensity scores to account for differences between groups. Differences in functional status score change among pooled data were analysed using linear models adjusted for propensity scores. Results: There were no clinically meaningful differences in patient outcomes when comparing clinician post-professional training level. The propensity score method proved to be a valuable way to account for differences at baseline between groups. Conclusion: Post-professional training does not appear to contribute to improved patient outcomes in the treatment of CLBP. This study demonstrates that propensity score analysis can be used to ensure that differences observed are true and not due to differences at baseline.},

In addition to numerous challenges in epidemiology, healthcare, biosciences, and social sciences, there has been an urgent need to develop and provide visualisation and visual analytics (VIS) capacities to support emergency responses under difficult operational conditions. In this paper, we report the experience of a group of VIS volunteers who have been working in a large research and development consortium and providing VIS support to various observational, analytical, model-developmental, and disseminative tasks. In particular, we describe our approaches to the challenges that we have encountered in requirements analysis, data acquisition, visual design, software design, system development, team organisation, and resource planning. By reflecting on our experience, we propose a set of recommendations as the first step towards a methodology for developing and providing rapid VIS capacities to support emergency responses.},

   abstract = {Students' demand for online learning has exploded during the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. However, due to their poor learning experience, students' dropout rate and learning performance of online learning are not always satisfactory. The technical advantages of Beyond Fifth Generation (B5G) can guarantee a good multimedia Quality of Experience (QoE). As a special case of multimedia services, online learning takes into account both the usability of the service and the cognitive development of the users. Factors that affect the Quality of Online Learning Experience (OL-QoE) become more complicated. To get over this dilemma, we propose a systematic scheme by integrating big data, Machine Learning (ML) technologies, and educational psychology theory. Specifically, we first formulate a general definition of OL-QoE by data analysis and experimental verification. This formula considers both the subjective and objective factors (i.e., video watching ratio and test scores) that most affect OL-QoE. Then, we induce an extended layer to the classic Broad Learning System (BLS) to construct an Extended Broad Learning System (EBLS) for the students' OL-QoE prediction. Since the extended layer can increase the width of the BLS model and reduce the redundant nodes of BLS, the proposed EBLS can achieve a trade-off between the prediction accuracy and computation complexity. Finally, we provide a series of early intervention suggestions for different types of students according to their predicted OL-QoE values. Through timely interventions, their OL-QoE and learning performance can be improved. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

   abstract = {With the outbreak of Covid-19, both people's health and the world economy are facing great challenges. Contact tracing scheme based on Bluetooth of smartphones has been regarded as a viable way to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. The existing schemes mainly belong to the centralized or the decentralized structure, both of which have their own limitations. It is infeasible for the existing schemes to balance the different demands of governments and users for user privacy and tracing efficiency at different periods of the epidemic. In this paper, we propose a hybrid contact tracing scheme named MLCT (multi-level contact tracing scheme) which is mainly based on short group signature. MLCT provides multiple privacy levels by applying anonymous credential technology and secret sharing technology to desensitize user identity privacy and encounter privacy. Comparing to the previous schemes, MLCT fully considers the different demands of the government, patients, and close contacts for user privacy and tracing efficiency in the different stages of Covid-19. The experimental results show viability in terms of the required resource from both server and mobile phone perspectives. And the security analysis demonstrates that MLCT can achieve the five targets security goals. It is expected that MLCT can contribute to the design and development of contact tracing schemes.},

   abstract = {In the study of infectious diseases on networks, researchers calculate epidemic thresholds to help forecast whether or not a disease will eventually infect a large fraction of a population. Because network structure typically changes with time, which fundamentally influences the dynamics of spreading processes and in turn affects epidemic thresholds for disease propagation, it is important to examine epidemic thresholds in models of disease spread on temporal networks. Most existing studies of epidemic thresholds in temporal networks have focused on models in discrete time, but most real-world networked systems evolve continuously with time. In our work, we encode the continuous time-dependence of networks in the evaluation of the epidemic threshold of a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) process by studying an SIS model on tie-decay networks. We derive the epidemic-threshold condition of this model, and we perform numerical experiments to verify it. We also examine how different factors - the decay coefficients of the tie strengths in a network, the frequency of the interactions between the nodes in the network, and the sparsity of the underlying social network on which interactions occur - lead to decreases or increases of the critical values of the threshold and hence contribute to facilitating or impeding the spread of a disease. We thereby demonstrate how the features of tie-decay networks alter the outcome of disease spread.},

Efficient and reliable prediction of RBD-hACE2 binding affinity changes upon amino acid substitutions can be valuable for public health surveillance and monitoring potential spillover and adaptation into non-human species. Here, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on protein sequence and structural features to predict experimental RBD-hACE2 binding affinities of 8,440 variants upon single and multiple amino acid substitutions in the RBD or ACE2. The model achieves a classification accuracy of 83.28% and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 between predicted and experimentally calculated binding affinities in five-fold cross-validation tests and predicts improved binding affinity for most circulating variants. We pro-actively used the CNN model to exhaustively screen for novel RBD variants with combinations of up to four single amino acid substitutions and suggested candidates with the highest improvements in RBD-ACE2 binding affinity for human and animal ACE2 receptors. We found that the binding affinity of RBD variants against animal ACE2s follows similar trends as those against human ACE2. White-tailed deer ACE2 binds to RBD almost as tightly as human ACE2 while cattle, pig, and chicken ACE2s bind weakly. The model allows testing whether adaptation of the virus for increased binding with other animals would cause concomitant increases in binding with hACE2 or decreased fitness due to adaptation to other hosts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {Production scheduling enables a production system to allocate resources for the efficient and low-cost production. However, pure mathematical methods are typically utilized for production scheduling, which are not understandable and practical for different domain engineers. Moreover, heterogeneous information during production scheduling may result in communication ambiguity or an information delay. Furthermore, the interaction and reuse of production data is limited, owing to the lack of a unified expression of the production information. To overcome these challenges, a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach based on the satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) is proposed to support production scheduling. A multiple architectural view modeling language, KARMA, is used as the basis to construct production scheduling elements and formalize the production scheduling processes using architecture models. Such graphical models are used to improve the understanding and communication among engineers in different domains. Then, property verification based on the MBSE and SMT is applied to solve the model constraints and select optimal schemes for the production scheduling. A case study of a package production line is proposed to evaluate our approach. Its scheduling goal is to maintain high production efficiency, decrease the working time and the cost of workers when increasing working distances during the COVID-19 pandemic. From the case study, we observed that KARMA language enables a description of modeling production scheduling and the optimization of scheduling schemes in a unified manner. Using the SMT solver, the constraints on scheduling corresponding to the sudden decrease in workers are evaluated to exclude inappropriate schemes and generate the optimal one.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Chest computed tomography (CT) is important for the early screening of lung diseases and clinical diagnosis, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a method for classifying peripheral lung cancer and focal pneumonia on chest CT images and undertake 5 window settings to study the effect on the artificial intelligence processing results. Methods: A retrospective collection of CT images from 357 patients with peripheral lung cancer having solitary solid nodule or focal pneumonia with a solitary consolidation was applied. We segmented and aligned the lung parenchyma based on some morphological methods and cropped this region of the lung parenchyma with the minimum 3D bounding box. Using these 3D cropped volumes of all cases, we designed a 3D neural network to classify them into 2 categories. We also compared the classification results of the 3 physicians with different experience levels on the same dataset. Results: We conducted experiments using 5 window settings. After cropping and alignment based on an automatic preprocessing procedure, our neural network achieved an average classification accuracy of 91.596% under a 5-fold cross-validation in the full window, in which the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.946. The classification accuracy and AUC value were 90.48% and 0.957 for the junior physician, 94.96% and 0.989 for the intermediate physician, and 96.92% and 0.980 for the senior physician, respectively. After removing the error prediction, the accuracy improved significantly, reaching 98.79% in the self-defined window2. Conclusion: Using the proposed neural network, in separating peripheral lung cancer and focal pneumonia in chest CT data, we achieved an accuracy competitive to that of a junior physician. Through a data ablation study, the proposed 3D CNN can achieve a slightly higher accuracy compared with senior physicians in the same subset. The self-defined window2 was the best for data training and evaluation.},

   abstract = {Increased social media use has contributed to the greater prevalence of abusive, rude, and offensive textual comments. Machine learning models have been developed to detect toxic comments online, yet these models tend to show biases against users with marginalized or minority identities (e.g., females and African Americans). Established research in debiasing toxicity classifiers often (1) takes a static or batch approach, assuming that all information is available and then making a one-time decision; and (2) uses a generic strategy to mitigate different biases (e.g., gender and racial biases) that assumes the biases are independent of one another. However, in real scenarios, the input typically arrives as a sequence of comments/words over time instead of all at once. Thus, decisions based on partial information must be made while additional input is arriving. Moreover, social bias is complex by nature. Each type of bias is defined within its unique context, which, consistent with intersectionality theory within the social sciences, might be correlated with the contexts of other forms of bias. In this work, we consider debiasing toxicity detection as a sequential decision-making process where different biases can be interdependent. In particular, we study debiasing toxicity detection with two aims: (1) to examine whether different biases tend to correlate with each other; and (2) to investigate how to jointly mitigate these correlated biases in an interactive manner to minimize the total amount of bias. At the core of our approach is a framework built upon theories of sequential Markov Decision Processes that seeks to maximize the prediction accuracy and minimize the bias measures tailored to individual biases. Evaluations on two benchmark datasets empirically validate the hypothesis that biases tend to be correlated and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed sequential debiasing strategy.},

   abstract = {Background: Electronic medical records (EMRs) are usually stored in relational databases that require SQL queries to retrieve information of interest. Effectively completing such queries can be a challenging task for medical experts due to the barriers in expertise. Existing text-to-SQL generation studies have not been fully embraced in the medical domain. Objective: The objective of this study was to propose a neural generation model that can jointly consider the characteristics of medical text and the SQL structure to automatically transform medical texts to SQL queries for EMRs. Methods: We proposed a medical text–to-SQL model (MedTS), which employed a pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers model as the encoder and leveraged a grammar-based long short-term memory network as the decoder to predict the intermediate representation that can easily be transformed into the final SQL query. We adopted the syntax tree as the intermediate representation rather than directly regarding the SQL query as an ordinary word sequence, which is more in line with the tree-structure nature of SQL and can also effectively reduce the search space during generation. Experiments were conducted on the MIMICSQL dataset, and 5 competitor methods were compared. Results: Experimental results demonstrated that MedTS achieved the accuracy of 0.784 and 0.899 on the test set in terms of logic form and execution, respectively, which significantly outperformed the existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analyses proved that the performance on each component of the generated SQL was relatively balanced and offered substantial improvements. Conclusions: The proposed MedTS was effective and robust for improving the performance of medical text–to-SQL generation, indicating strong potential to be applied in the real medical scenario.},

   abstract = {Background: Overweight and obesity have now reached a state of a pandemic despite the clinical and commercial programs available. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in optimizing such programs for weight loss. Objective: This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user engagement. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9, 2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also searched. Results: A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35%) focused on using AI chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13% (3/23) of the studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and obesity risk assessment whereas only 4% (1/23) of the studies focused on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management. In total, 48% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based AI chatbots, 52% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through smartphones, and 39% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87%), motivational messages (18/23, 78%), gamification (6/23, 26%), and emotional support (6/23, 26%). Study participants who experienced speech- and augmented reality–based chatbot interactions in addition to text-based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement. The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of credible information sources; personification; validation; and the provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social media platforms, devices, and appliances. Conclusions: AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like, personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective recommendations for weight loss.},

   abstract = {Hypertension, or high blood pressure (BP), is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world, affecting 30% of American adults and contributing to over 410,000 deaths per year. Although the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions on BP management has been proven in many studies, the degree of impact of each lifestyle factor on BP is unknown and may vary significantly between individuals. In this dissertation, we propose to use machine learning techniques to elucidate the complex relationships between BP and lifestyle factors at the level of the individual. Based on the continuous data collected from wearables of users, we aim to 1) provide a prediction of BP, which will give users a quick and reliable way to understand their health condition, and 2) provide personalized and actionable insight to users in order to control their BP by adjusting their lifestyle accordingly.Firstly, we extract necessary and interpretable features from lifestyle data. To utilize temporal information from the BP series, we propose to extract new features based on ARIMA to enhance the accuracy of BP prediction. We propose a machine learning method to explore the personalized relationship between BP and lifestyle factors collected by wearables. The proposed system provides BP prediction as well as lifestyle recommendations. Furthermore, since BP and health behavior data are collected and learned sequentially, the performance of prediction is prone to the existence of concept drifts and anomaly points. To solve this problem, we propose an Online Weighted-Resampling (OWR) technique to enhance RFFS in an online learning scenario. Thirdly, we propose a feature selection method using feature importance derived from Shapley Value, in order to remove redundant and irrelevant features and provide the personalized insight that may affect an individual's BP. We evaluate and show that our proposed technique outperforms other popular machine learning methods in terms of prediction error. We also show the effectiveness of personalized recommendations using a randomized controlled trial.In the final section, earlier work in green communication, which utilize renewable energy to reduce grid energy consumption of base station (BSs), is presented. We propose to utilize data buffer of user equipment as well as energy storage at the BS to better adapt the BS resource allocation and hence its energy consumption to the dynamic nature of RE.},

   abstract = {Backgroud: uring the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning has played an increasingly crucial role in the educational system. Academic dishonesty (AD) in online learning is a challenging problem that represents a complex psychological and social phenomenon for learners. However, there is a lack of comprehensive and systematic reviews of AD in online learning environments. Objectives: This study presents a systematic study of AD in online learning environments to delineate its trends and uncover potential areas for further research. Methods: We conducted this review based on various sources of evidence-based research and followed the guidelines of the PRISMA statement and procedure for selection. After the exclusion criteria were employed, 59 eligible articles were selected and then analysed in a descriptive overview. Two frameworks were identified in the structured content analysis to analyse these articles. One was the framework of Gilbert's Behaviour Engineering Model (BEM), and the other was the types of interventions for online AD, where 36 articles were analysed. Results and Conclusions: The descriptive results showed that most studies used quantitative methods and focused on students. The analysis results of influencing factors under the BEM framework showed that the category of environment support and tools accounts for the largest proportion. And the types of interventions for online AD we classified include individual AD & high technological complexity, individual AD & low technological complexity, collective AD & high technological complexity, and collective AD & low technological complexity. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding and guidance of AD in the online environment for relevant managers, designers and developers.},

Based on the nonlinear Hammerstein–Wiener model, the first part of this study outlines the estimation of different sub-models to mimic diverse force profiles. The second part fixes the appropriate sub-models of a mul-timodel library and computes the contribution of sub-models to estimate the desired force. Based on a pre-existing dataset, the obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach to estimate muscle force from EMG signals with reasonable accuracy. The coefficient of determination ranges from 0.6568 to 0.9754 using the proposed method compared with a range of 0.5060 to 0.9329 using an artificial neural network (ANN), generating significantly different accuracy (p < 0.03). Results imply that the use of multimodel approach can improve the accuracy in proportional control of prostheses.},

In March 2020, WHO announced this epidemic had become a global pandemic and that the novel coronavirus may be mild to most people. However, some people may experience a severe illness that results in hospitalization or maybe death. COVID-19 classification remains challenging due to the ambiguity and similarity with other known respiratory diseases such as SARS, MERS, and other viral pneumonia. The typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, chills, shortness of breath, loss of smell and taste, headache, sore throat, chest pains, confusion, and diarrhoea. This research paper suggests the concept of transfer learning using the deterministic algorithm in all binary classification models and evaluates the performance of various CNN architectures. The datasets of 746 CT images of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 were divided for training, validation, and testing. Various augmentation techniques were applied to increase the number of datasets except for testing images. The images were then pretrained using CNN to obtain a binary class. ResNeXt101 and ResNet152 have the best F1 score of 0.978 and 0.938, whereas GoogleNet has an F1 score of 0.762. ResNeXt101 and ResNet152 have an accuracy of 97.81% and 93.80%. ResNeXt101, DenseNet201, and ResNet152 have 95.71%, 93.81%, and 90% sensitivity, whereas ResNeXt101, ResNet101, and ResNet152 have 100%, 99.58%, and 98.33 specificity, respectively.},

Philosophy has always been a promising tool for facing puzzling scenarios. Yet, contemporary philosophy may not be able to successfully face our era’s unprecedented complexity and uncertainty. On the one hand, contemporary philosophy results from a kind of hypertrophisation of logos restricting the forms of rationality legitimately usable. On the other hand, our era’s unprecedented complexity and uncertainty seem to require not only restricted forms of rationality, such as logic and computation, but also other forms of rationality underdeveloped in our philosophical tradition, such as wisdom. This paper proposes reasons why increasing our focus on wisdom may help us face our unprecedentedly complex and uncertain era in four respects as philosophers: when educating our students; when publishing our work; when talking to civil society; and when acting in our technological era.},

Ethnic subgroups also have more variable outcomes than the monolithic category, “Asians or Asian Americans,” may suggest, but even across communities, few utilize mental health care compared to other racial/ethnic groups. To illustrate the needed evidence, a longitudinal survey of Filipino and Korean Americans found that mental distress among young Asian Americans increased at an alarming rate during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Two prominent contextual factors, parent–child conflict and racial discrimination, explained the uptick in mental distress. The surge of anti-Asian discrimination since the COVID-19 pandemic requires anti-discrimination policy, while parent–child conflict requires working with families in a culturally competent way.},

However, how it affects logistics and production over the past years as well as what should be examined next remain unclear. This paper fills this gap by first discussing the evolution of blockchain (from Blockchain 1.0 to Blockchain 5.0). Then, we examine the related production and logistics management literature and highlight the current states of knowledge in the field. We review in more details the analytical and empirical studies and uncover the research methods, topics, insights and implications. After that, with references to both the examined literature and observed industrial practices, we identify various important research gaps one by one. We build the intra-inter-organizational (IIO) operational framework to highlight the importance of both internal (i.e., intra-organizational level) and inter-organizational considerations in order to adopt blockchain successfully in production and logistics systems. Critical factors for implementing blockchain under the IIO framework are uncovered. Finally, based on the IIO framework, a future research agenda, which relates to the different stages of blockchain development as well as different topical areas, is established.},

   abstract = {This study focuses on the comprehensive investigation of stop-and-go waves appearing in closed-circuit ring road traffic wherein we evaluate various longitudinal dynamical models for vehicles. It is known that the behavior of human-driven vehicles, with other traffic elements such as density held constant, could stimulate stop-and-go waves, which do not dissipate on the circuit ring road. Stop-and-go waves can be dissipated by adding automated vehicles (AVs) to the ring. Thorough investigations of the performance of AV longitudinal control algorithms were carried out in Flow, which is an integrated platform for reinforcement learning on traffic control. Ten AV algorithms presented in the literature are evaluated. For each AV algorithm, experiments are carried out by varying distributions and penetration rates of AVs. Two different distributions of AVs are studied. For the first distribution scenario, AVs are placed consecutively. Penetration rates are varied from 1 AV (5%) to all AVs (100%). For the second distribution scenario, AVs are placed with even distribution of human-driven vehicles in between any two AVs. In this scenario, penetration rates are varied from 2 AVs (10%) to 11 AVs (50%). Multiple runs (10 runs) are simulated to average out the randomness in the results. From more than 3,000 simulation experiments, we investigated how AV algorithms perform differently with varying distributions and penetration rates while all AV algorithms remained fixed under all distributions and penetration rates. Time to stabilize, maximum headway, vehicle miles traveled, and fuel economy are used to evaluate their performance. Using these metrics, we find that the traffic condition improvement is not necessarily dependent on the distribution for most of the AV controllers, particularly when no cooperation among AVs is considered. Traffic condition is generally improved with a higher AV penetration rate with only one of the AV algorithms showing a contrary trend. Among all AV algorithms in this study, the reinforcement learning controller shows the most consistent improvement under all distributions and penetration rates.},

   abstract = {The pandemic COVID 19 has altered individuals’ daily lives across the globe. It has led to preventive measures such as physical distancing to be imposed on individuals and led to terms such as ‘lockdown,’ ‘emergency,’ or curfew’ to emerge in various countries. It has affected society, not only physically and financially, but in terms of emotional wellbeing as well. This distress in the human emotional quotient results from multiple factors such as financial implications, family member’s behavior and support, country-specific lockdown protocols, media influence, or fear of the pandemic. For efficient pandemic management, there is a need to understand the emotional variations among individuals, as this will provide insights into public sentiment towards various government pandemic management policies. From our investigations, it was found that individuals have increasingly used different microblogging platforms such as Twitter to remain connected and express their feelings and concerns during the pandemic. However, research in the area of expressed emotional wellbeing during COVID 19 is still growing, which motivated this team to form the aim: To identify, explore and understand globally the emotions expressed during the earlier months of the pandemic COVID 19 by utilizing Deep Learning and Natural language Processing (NLP). For the data collection, over 2 million tweets during February–June 2020 were collected and analyzed using an advanced deep learning technique of Transfer Learning and Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). A Reddit-based standard Emotion Dataset by Crowdflower was utilized for transfer learning. Using RoBERTa and the collated Twitter dataset, a multi-class emotion classifier system was formed. With the implemented methodology, a tweet classification accuracy of 80.33% and an average MCC score of 0.78 was achieved, improving the existing AI-based emotion classification methods. This study explains the novel application of the Roberta model during the pandemic that provided insights into changing emotional wellbeing over time of various citizens worldwide. It also offers novelty for data mining and analytics during this challenging, pandemic era. These insights can be beneficial for formulating effective pandemic management strategies and devising a novel, predictive strategy for the emotional well-being of an entire country’s citizens when facing future unexpected exogenous shocks.},

   abstract = {This research aims to analyze the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for classifying COVID-19 from cough sounds and to identify the model(s) that consistently perform well across different cough datasets. Different performance evaluation metrics (precision, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, accuracy, etc.) make selecting the best performance model difficult. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an ensemble-based multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method for selecting top performance machine learning technique(s) for COVID-19 cough classification. We use four cough datasets, namely Cambridge, Coswara, Virufy, and NoCoCoDa to verify the proposed method. At first, our proposed method uses the audio features of cough samples and then applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify them as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. Then, we consider a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that combines ensemble technologies (i.e., soft and hard) to select the best model. In MCDM, we use the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for ranking purposes, while entropy is applied to calculate evaluation criteria weights. In addition, we apply the feature reduction process through recursive feature elimination with cross-validation under different estimators. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. We see that when the proposed method is used for analysis using the Extra-Trees classifier, it has achieved promising results (AUC: 0.95, Precision: 1, Recall: 0.97).},

The development of intelligent machine learning–based clinical decision support systems is facing great opportunities and challenges. Clinical decision support systems may directly help clinicians accurately diagnose, predict outcomes, identify risk events, or decide treatments at the point of care. Objective: We aimed to review the research and application of machine learning–enabled clinical decision support studies in intensive care units to help clinicians, researchers, developers, and policy makers better understand the advantages and limitations of machine learning–supported diagnosis, outcome prediction, risk event identification, and intensive care unit point-of-care recommendations. Methods: We searched papers published in the PubMed database between January 1980 and October 2020. We defined selection criteria to identify papers that focused on machine learning–enabled clinical decision support studies in intensive care units and reviewed the following aspects: research topics, study cohorts, machine learning models, analysis variables, and evaluation metrics. Results: A total of 643 papers were collected, and using our selection criteria, 97 studies were found. Studies were categorized into 4 topics—monitoring, detection, and diagnosis (13/97, 13.4%), early identification of clinical events (32/97, 33.0%), outcome prediction and prognosis assessment (46/97, 47.6%), and treatment decision (6/97, 6.2%). Of the 97 papers, 82 (84.5%) studies used data from adult patients, 9 (9.3%) studies used data from pediatric patients, and 6 (6.2%) studies used data from neonates. We found that 65 (67.0%) studies used data from a single center, and 32 (33.0%) studies used a multicenter data set; 88 (90.7%) studies used supervised learning, 3 (3.1%) studies used unsupervised learning, and 6 (6.2%) studies used reinforcement learning. Clinical variable categories, starting with the most frequently used, were demographic (n=74), laboratory values (n=59), vital signs (n=55), scores (n=48), ventilation parameters (n=43), comorbidities (n=27), medications (n=18), outcome (n=14), fluid balance (n=13), nonmedicine therapy (n=10), symptoms (n=7), and medical history (n=4). The most frequently adopted evaluation metrics for clinical data modeling studies included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (n=61), sensitivity (n=51), specificity (n=41), accuracy (n=29), and positive predictive value (n=23). Conclusions: Early identification of clinical and outcome prediction and prognosis assessment contributed to approximately 80% of studies included in this review. Using new algorithms to solve intensive care unit clinical problems by developing reinforcement learning, active learning, and time-series analysis methods for clinical decision support will be greater development prospects in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Nurses are susceptible to several mental problems, such as fear, stress, and depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which affects their emotional well-being. However, resilience plays an important role in mitigating the effects of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE This study was to examine the mediating role of resilience in the relation between fear, stress, and depression of nurses during COVID-19 health emergencies. METHODS A cross-sectional-predictive study was carried out. The variables analyzed were fear, resilience, stress, and depression. A total of 286 nurses from 2 hospitals in the cities of Juliaca and Puno, Peru. Data analyses were performed using structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS Analyses showed that the variables were significantly related (P < .01). In addition, a confirmatory analysis of the hypothesized model using structural equation modeling shows that fear and stress are predictors of depression, and that resilience plays a role in mediating the effect of fear on stress (X2 = 534.69, gl = 372, P = .000; TLI = .902, CFI = .910, RMSEA = .039 [95% CI = 0.032-0.046], and SRMR = .065). CONCLUSION Nurses tend to develop fear, stress, and depression. Resilience reduces the impact of these psychological variables. Hospital management should provide psychological support and training for nurses in coping strategies.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 infection evokes various systemic alterations that push patients not only towards severe acute respiratory syndrome but causes an important metabolic dysregulation with following multi-organ alteration and potentially poor outcome. To discover novel potential biomarkers able to predict disease's severity and patient's outcome, in this study we applied untargeted lipidomics, by a reversed phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry platform (RP-UHPLC-TIMS-MS), on blood samples collected at hospital admission in an Italian cohort of COVID-19 patients (45 mild, 54 severe, 21 controls). In a subset of patients, we also collected a second blood sample in correspondence of clinical phenotype modification (longitudinal population). Plasma lipid profiles revealed several lipids significantly modified in COVID-19 patients with respect to controls and able to discern between mild and severe clinical phenotype. Severe patients were characterized by a progressive decrease in the levels of LPCs, LPC-Os, PC-Os, and, on the contrary, an increase in overall TGs, PEs, and Ceramides. A machine learning model was built by using both the entire dataset and with a restricted lipid panel dataset, delivering comparable results in predicting severity (AUC= 0.777, CI: 0.639–0.904) and outcome (AUC= 0.789, CI: 0.658–0.910). Finally, re-building the with 25 longitudinal (t1) samples, this resulted in 21 patients correctly classified. In conclusion, this study highlights specific lipid profiles that could be used monitor the possible trajectory of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission, which could be used in targeted approaches.},

   abstract = {The accurate and reliable assessment of gait parameters is assuming an important role, especially in the perspective of designing new therapeutic and rehabilitation strategies for the remote follow‐up of people affected by disabling neurological diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and post‐stroke injuries, in particular considering how gait represents a fundamental motor activity for the autonomy, domestic or otherwise, and the health of neurological patients. To this end, the study presents an easy‐to‐use and non‐invasive solution, based on a single RGB‐D sensor, to estimate specific features of gait patterns on a reduced walking path compatible with the available spaces in domestic settings. Traditional spatio‐temporal parameters and features linked to dynamic instability during walking are estimated on a cohort of ten parkinsonian and eleven post‐stroke subjects using a custom‐written software that works on the result of a body‐tracking algorithm. Then, they are compared with the “gold standard” 3D instrumented gait analysis system. The statistical analysis confirms no statistical difference between the two systems. Data also indicate that the RGB‐D system is able to estimate features of gait patterns in pathological individuals and differences between them in line with other studies. Although they are preliminary, the results suggest that this solution could be clinically helpful in evolutionary disease monitoring, especially in domestic and unsupervised environments where traditional gait analysis is not usable.},

The patient was treated with 56 sessions of psychoanalytic psychotherapy utilizing an object relations approach. Treatment aimed at decreasing the patient’s anger, anxiety, depression, and improving emotion regulation. Another focus of this patient’s treatment was helping him gain insight into the nature of his unconscious predictions and interpretations of others’ behavior in the hope that he may begin to experience relationships with greater emotional connection and less conflict. Treatment outcomes were measured using Reliable Change Index analyses, which indicated a significant reduction in anxiety, depression, anger, and emotion regulation difficulty between the beginning of treatment and the most recent session. The patient also demonstrated increased mentalization abilities and fewer anger outbursts throughout the course of treatment. During the sessions surrounding a therapeutic rupture, the patient’s emotion regulation abilities worsened temporarily; therapy shifted during this time to a more supportive analytic framework. An object relations-focused theoretical background and clinical treatment implications are discussed in relation to this case.},

This paper examines how managers actually think about resilience strategies, and then analyzes the relationship between operations, supply-chain characteristics, and the implemented strategies. We define a “Triple-P” framework that matches resilience strategies to supply-chain archetypes by examining Product, Partnership, and Process complexity based on interviews of senior supply-chain executives. These interviews revealed two major influencers of resilience strategy, that is, Homogeneity of internal supply-chain processes and Integration with other actors in their end-to-end supply chains. We found that the supply chains have different resilience requirements, have different ways to achieve resilience (which we conceptualize as “bespoke supply-chain resilience”), and face different obstacles to resilience. This study aims at initiating a dialogue between supply-chain scholars and practitioners to support more research for developing an effective supply-chain resilience strategy.},

From February to October 2021, VE-I declined for all vaccine types, and the decline was greatest for the Janssen vaccine, resulting in a VE-I of 13.1%. Although breakthrough infection increased risk of death, vaccination remained protective against death in persons who became infected during the Delta variant surge. From July to October 2021, VE-D for age <65 years was 73.0% for Janssen, 81.5% for Moderna, and 84.3% for Pfizer-BioNTech; VE-D for age ≥65 years was 52.2% for Janssen, 75.5% for Moderna, and 70.1% for Pfizer-BioNTech.

   abstract = {Systematic differences between batches of samples present significant challenges when analysing biological data. Such batch effects are well-studied and are liable to occur in any setting where multiple batches are assayed. Many existing methods for accounting for these have focused on high-dimensional data such as RNA-seq and have assumptions that reflect this. Here we focus on batch-correction in low-dimensional classification problems. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian generative classifier based on mixture models that jointly predicts class labels and models batch effects. Our model allows observations to be probabilistically assigned to classes in a way that incorporates uncertainty arising from batch effects. We explore two choices for the within-class densities: the multivariate normal and the multivariate t. A simulation study demonstrates that our method performs well compared to popular off-the-shelf machine learning methods and is also quick; performing 15,000 iterations on a dataset of 500 samples with 2 measurements each in 7.3 seconds for the MVN mixture model and 11.9 seconds for the MVT mixture model. We apply our model to two datasets generated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a spectrophotometric assay often used to screen for antibodies. The examples we consider were collected in 2020 and measure seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. We use our model to estimate seroprevalence in the populations studied. We implement the models in C++ using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm; this is available in the R package at https://github.com/stcolema/BatchMixtureModel.

Interest in LM has greatly advanced in the face of disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, expanded educational opportunities in the field, and a rapidly changing healthcare landscape. With growing access to virtual care, advancing technologies, growing emphasis on home-based chronic care, continuing corporate healthcare mergers and acquisitions, and widening adoption of personalized, patient-empowered treatments, the time is ripe for LM interventions to move to the mainstream. As health investments and costs skyrocket, and new players enter the scene, traditional models of payments, reimbursements, and incentives are slowly being upended. Companies and healthcare systems are finally recognizing the scientific evidence and powerful but undervalued potential of LM to accelerate healthy outcomes while controlling costs. Taken together, the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the growth in LM educational opportunities, and the evolving “business of medicine landscape” signal that the time for lifestyle medicine is NOW.},

However, in many settings of interest, agent utility functions themselves vary as a result of past agent choices. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic provides an example: a highly prevalent virus may incentivize individuals to wear masks, but extensive adoption of mask-wearing reduces virus prevalence which in turn reduces individual incentives for mask-wearing. This paper develops a general framework using probabilistic coupling methods that can be used to derive the stochastically stable states of log-linear learning in certain games which feature such game-environment feedback. As a case study, we apply this framework to a simple dynamic game-theoretic model of social precautions in an epidemic and give conditions under which maximally-cautious social behavior in this model is stochastically stable.},

Mechanistic approaches such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models have traditionally been used to achieve this objective. However, formulating such models is challenged by the necessity to formulate equations for plausible causal mechanisms between the intensity of COVID-19 transmission and external epidemic drivers such as temperature, and the stringency of nonpharmaceutical interventions. Here, we combined a neural network model (NN) with a Susceptible- Exposed-Infected-Recovered model (SEIR) in a hybrid model and attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of existing models used to forecast ICU occupancy. Between 1st of October, 2020 - 1st of July, 2021, the hybrid model improved performances of the SEIR model at different geographical levels. At a national level, the hybrid model improved, prediction accuracy (i.e., mean absolute error) by 74%. At the cantonal and hospital levels, the reduction on the forecast's mean absolute error were 46% and 50%, respectively. Our findings illustrate those predictions from hybrid model can be used to anticipate occupancy in ICU, and support the decision-making for lifesaving actions such as the transfer of patients and dispatching of medical personnel and ventilators.},

   abstract = {Background: Online and blended learning need an appropriate assessment strategy which ensures academic integrity. During the pandemic, many universities have chosen for online proctoring. Although some earlier examples suggest that online proctoring may reduce cheating, the potential side-effects of proctoring are largely unknown. Objectives: Therefore, this study aims to identify the effects of proctoring on students' self-reported temptation to cheat and potentially undesirable side-effects, including test anxiety, perceived exam difficulty, and performance. In addition, we examine which contextual and student characteristics affect test anxiety during online exams. Methods: For this, we collected four waves of survey data throughout a year of teaching during the pandemic at one faculty of a Dutch university, resulting in a total sample of 1760 students within 105 courses. Results and Conclusions: Multi-level analyses showed that while proctoring had no effect on the temptation to cheat, exam difficulty or performance, students reported higher levels of test anxiety. Some learning strategies, internet literacy, access to a reliable technology and a dedicated study space as well as gender and financial stress affect their test anxiety. To conclude, the decision to use online proctoring needs to consider the undesirable side-effect on test anxiety. We discuss practical implications for university administrators, educational designers and teachers to reduce test anxiety.},

In the next generation of healthcare systems, self-diagnosis will be pivotal to personalised healthcare services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new screening and diagnostic approaches like mobile health are well-positioned to reduce disease spread and overcome geographical barriers. This paper presents a non-invasive screening approach to predict the health of a person from visually observable features using machine learning techniques. Images like face and skin surface of the patients are acquired using camera or mobile devices and analysed to derive clinical reasoning and prediction of the person's health. Methods: In specific, a two-level classification approach is presented. The proposed hierarchical model chooses a class by training a binary classifier at the node of the hierarchy. Prediction is then made using a set of class-specific reduced feature set. Results: Testing accuracies of 86.87% and 76.84% are reported for the first and second-level classification. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields favourable prediction results while greatly reduces the computational time. Conclusions: The study suggests that it is possible to predict the health condition of a person based on his/her face appearance using cost-effective machine learning approaches.},

   abstract = {During the first COVID-19 related confinement in Portugal, there was a decrease in the levels of psychological symptoms measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (March to April 2020). Upon experiencing a new period of restraints in 2021, the psychological impact of this sample was assessed again (N = 322, two more time points). It was expected that the psychological symptoms evidenced in February 2021 would be at similar levels to those found in April 2020, leading to a transfer of adaptation. Contrary to our hypothesis, in the second confinement in Portugal there were higher levels of depression and stress symptoms than at the beginning of the pandemic. On the other hand, the maximum level of anxiety was observed in March 2020. It seems that our perception of the threats in 2021 was not the same as at the onset of COVID-19, or that knowledge was not disseminated to the general population to increase their mental health literacy and help them cope with the imposed challenges.},

Methods and analysis A prospective multicentre study, with five axes. First, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among women admitted for childbirth will be described in a cross-sectional study. Second, maternal and perinatal outcomes will be assessed in a prospective cohort study including pregnant or postpartum women with suspected COVID-19. Third, a cohort of positive COVID-19 cases with sampling of a variety of biological material. Histopathological and viral analysis of biological maternal and neonatal samples will be performed, and the assessment of nutritional variables to evaluate the association between vitamin D and severity of infection. Fourth, a monitoring and evaluation committee to collect relevant healthcare information and plan actions in centres facing the pandemic. Furthermore, qualitative studies will be performed to study pregnant women, their families and health professionals. Fifth, an ecological study will monitor the number of live births, stillbirths and other outcomes to explore any trend among the periods before, during and after the pandemic. Data will systematically be collected in an electronic platform following standardised operational procedures. For quantitative study components, an appropriate statistical approach will be used for each analysis. For qualitative data, in-depth interviews recorded in audio will be transcribed, checking the text obtained with the recording. Subsequently, thematic analysis with the aid of the NVivo programme will be performed. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained (letters of approval numbers 4.047.168, 4.179.679 and 4.083.988). All women will be fully informed to sign the consent form before enrolment in the study. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences.},

Under this context, we investigated associations of HEXACO personality with COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (self-reported hygiene, distancing, going out). We tested unique associations through regularized regressions and out-of-sample prediction after establishing the best level of analysis (HEXACO traits, facets, items). Personality always explained out-of-sample variance over and above demographics, COVID-related knowledge, concern, impacts, and goals. Hygiene and distancing were best predicted by HEXACO traits, whereas facets constituted the best level for the prediction of going out. In general, honesty-humility (trait or facets) was the clearest predictor of safer behaviors. Results corroborate the relevance of personality even in strong situations, as well as its importance for COVID-19 mitigation.},

The application of omics techniques has been addressed to every level of application, from the detection of mutations, methods of diagnosis or monitoring, drug target discovery, and vaccine generation, to the basic definition of the pathophysiological processes and the biochemical mechanisms behind the infection and spread of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the term COVIDomics wants to include those efforts provided by omics-scale investigations with application to the current COVID-19 research. This review summarizes the diverse pieces of knowledge acquired with the application of COVIDomics techniques, with the main focus on proteomics and metabolomics studies, in order to capture a common signature in terms of proteins, metabolites, and pathways dysregulated in COVID-19 disease. Exploring the multiomics perspective and the concurrent data integration may provide new suitable therapeutic solutions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.},

To leverage these forecasts, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with an academic research lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to create the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Launched in April 2020, the Forecast Hub is a dataset with point and probabilistic forecasts of incident cases, incident hospitalizations, incident deaths, and cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 at county, state, and national, levels in the United States. Included forecasts represent a variety of modeling approaches, data sources, and assumptions regarding the spread of COVID-19. The goal of this dataset is to establish a standardized and comparable set of short-term forecasts from modeling teams. These data can be used to develop ensemble models, communicate forecasts to the public, create visualizations, compare models, and inform policies regarding COVID-19 mitigation. These open-source data are available via download from GitHub, through an online API, and through R packages.</p>},

   abstract = {Abstract Fossil fuel combustion, land use change and other human activities have increased the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) abundance by about 50% since the beginning of the industrial age. The atmospheric CO2 growth rates would have been much larger if natural sinks in the land biosphere and ocean had not removed over half of this anthropogenic CO2. As these CO2 emissions grew, uptake by the ocean increased in response to increases in atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). On land, gross primary production also increased, but the dynamics of other key aspects of the land carbon cycle varied regionally. Over the past three decades, CO2 uptake by intact tropical humid forests declined, but these changes are offset by increased uptake across mid- and high-latitudes. While there have been substantial improvements in our ability to study the carbon cycle, measurement and modeling gaps still limit our understanding of the processes driving its evolution. Continued ship-based observations combined with expanded deployments of autonomous platforms are needed to quantify ocean-atmosphere fluxes and interior ocean carbon storage on policy-relevant spatial and temporal scales. There is also an urgent need for more comprehensive measurements of stocks, fluxes and atmospheric CO2 in humid tropical forests and across the Arctic and boreal regions, which are experiencing rapid change. Here, we review our understanding of the atmosphere, ocean, and land carbon cycles and their interactions, identify emerging measurement and modeling capabilities and gaps and the need for a sustainable, operational framework to ensure a scientific basis for carbon management.},

   abstract = {<p>Chatbots have become common in digital customer service contexts across many industries. While many companies choose to humanize their customer service chatbots (e.g., giving them names and avatars), little is known about how anthropomorphism influences customer responses to chatbots in service settings. Across five studies, including an analysis of a large real-world data set from an international telecommunications company and four experiments, the authors find that when customers enter a chatbot-led service interaction in an angry emotional state, chatbot anthropomorphism has a negative effect on customer satisfaction, overall firm evaluation, and subsequent purchase intentions. However, this is not the case for customers in nonangry emotional states. The authors uncover the underlying mechanism driving this negative effect (expectancy violations caused by inflated pre-encounter expectations of chatbot efficacy) and offer practical implications for managers. These findings suggest that it is important to both carefully design chatbots and consider the emotional context in which they are used, particularly in customer service interactions that involve resolving problems or handling complaints.</p>},

   abstract = {Hate speech is a major issue in social networks due to the high volume of data generated daily. Recent works demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning (ML) in dealing with the nuances required to distinguish between hateful posts from just sarcasm or offensive language. Many ML solutions for hate speech detection have been proposed by either changing how features are extracted from the text or the classification algorithm employed. However, most works consider only one type of feature extraction and classification algorithm. This work argues that a combination of multiple feature extraction techniques and different classification models is needed. We propose a framework to analyze the relationship between multiple feature extraction and classification techniques to understand how they complement each other. The framework is used to select a subset of complementary techniques to compose a robust multiple classifiers system (MCS) for hate speech detection. The experimental study considering four hate speech classification datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework is a promising methodology for analyzing and designing high-performing MCS for this task. MCS system obtained using the proposed framework significantly outperforms the combination of all models and the homogeneous and heterogeneous selection heuristics, demonstrating the importance of having a proper selection scheme.

Nonlinear analysis methods, including equilibrium analysis, stability evaluation, and time series investigation, are intensely explored to describe the cooperation and competition dynamics in maritime logistics. The dynamical analysis indicates that the port competition system shows a complex and highly nonlinear behaviour, notably illustrating unstable equilibria and even chaotic phenomena. Besides, nonlinear dynamical interactions in seaport management have been analysed by exploiting fractional calculus (FC) and system dynamics theory. Novel multi-criteria decision-making strategies realized by the neural network prediction controller (NNC) and adaptive fractional-order super-twisting sliding mode control (AFOSTSM) have been presented for dealing with throughput dynamics under parametric perturbations and external disturbances. Particularly, the active control algorithms are implemented to ensure the recovery strategy for throughput growth of Vietnam ports in the post-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic era. The case study has confirmed the efficacy of the proposed strategy by using system dynamics and control theory. The simulation results show that the average growth rates of container throughput can be ensured up to 7.46% by exploiting resilience management scheme. The presented method can be also utilized for providing managerial insights and solutions on efficient port operations. In addition, the control strategies with neural network forecasting can help managers obtain timely and cost-effective decision-making policy for port sustainability against unprecedented impacts on global supply chains related to COVID-19 pandemic.},

This study provides the results of a brief investigation of the main factors that contribute the success of DT and demonstrates the value of using technology roadmapping alongside systems engineering (SE) practices to create a path between identified “AS-IS” and “TO-BE” operational states. Applying SE methods to the adoption of the “T-Plan” roadmapping process resulted in a strategic communication tool that can be used among stakeholders to support them with the integration of business planning and technology adoption, and to help assess the impact that new technologies may have on their organizations in their journey toward a successful DT. In addition to the roadmap itself, which benefits the case company, this study contributes to building and enriching academic literature by providing insight from the oil and gas industry and demonstrating the use of technology roadmapping to create a strategic plan for DT in a well-established industrial domain.},

   abstract = {The increase in energy consumption is affected by the developments in technology as well as the global population growth. Increasing energy consumption makes it difficult to ensure electrical energy supply security. Meeting the energy demand can be achieved with the right planning. Proper planning is critical for both economical use of resources and low cost for the end consumer. On the other hand, erroneous estimation of demand may cause waste of resources and energy crisis. Accurate estimation is possible by accurately modeling the factors affecting electricity consumption. Apart from known factors such as seasonal conditions, days of the week and hours, modeling in extreme events such as pandemics that affect all our behaviors increases the success in modeling the future projection. This ensures that the security of electrical energy supply is carried out effectively with limited resources. For this purpose, in this study, a hybrid multiple linear regression-feedforward artificial neural network (MLR-FFANN) based algorithm model was proposed, taking into account the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the energy consumption values of Bursa, an industrial city in Turkey. The aim of the hybrid MLR-FFANN approach was to simultaneously optimize the β polynomial for multiple linear regression and the weight and bias coefficients for the forward propagation neural network using the adaptive guided differential evolution, equilibrium optimizer, slime mold algorithm, and stochastic fractal search with fitness distance balance (SFSFDB) optimization algorithms. The success of the model whose parameters were optimized using the optimization algorithms was determined according to mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error evaluation criteria and statistical analysis of these results. According to the results of the analysis, the MLR-FFANN approach whose parameters were optimized with the SFSFDB algorithm was more successful in the training of the dataset containing the COVID-19 precautions.},

   abstract = {Pedestrian routing is important in a multitude of public spaces, especially those characterized by a large number of newcomers. Their needs may be diverse, with priority for the shortest path, the less crowded or the less polluted one, the accessibility for reduced mobility, or the sheltering from unfavorable weather conditions. Hence, typical graph-based routing must be enriched to support multiple policies, at the choice of each person. The paper proposes a systemic approach and a set of services for orientation and accessibility, which are both community-driven and data-driven, for correctly perceiving the routing necessities and the surrounding situation. The response time to a pathfinding query depends on the types of policies applied and not only on their number, because each of them contributes to the customization of the weighted graph, although it refers to the same physical space traversed by pedestrians. The paper also presents results of loading tests for up to 5000 Virtual Users, inspired from real-life requirements and executed on a graph that models a real building in our university; different policies are applied to assess performance metrics, with simulated community feedback and sensor data.},

   abstract = {Background: Enabling the use of spatial context is vital to understanding today's digital health problems. Any given location is associated with many different contexts. The strategic transformation of population health, epidemiology, and eHealth studies requires vast amounts of integrated digital data. Needed is a novel analytical framework designed to leverage location to create new contextual knowledge. The Geospatial Analytical Research Knowledgebase (GeoARK), a web-based research resource has robust, locationally integrated, social, environmental, and infrastructural information to address today's complex questions, investigate context, and spatially enable health investigations. GeoARK is different from other Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in that it has taken the layered world of the GIS and flattened it into a big data table that ties all the data and information together using location and developing its context. Objective: It is paramount to build a robust spatial data analytics framework that integrates social, environmental, and infrastructural knowledge to empower health researchers' use of geospatial context to timely answer population health issues. The goal is twofold in that it embodies an innovative technological approach and serves to ease the educational burden for health researchers to think spatially about their problems. Methods: A unique analytical tool using location as the key was developed. It allows integration across source, geography, and time to create a geospatial big table with over 162 million individual locations (X-Y points that serve as rows) and 5549 attributes (represented as columns). The concept of context (adjacency, proximity, distance, etc) is quantified through geoanalytics and captured as new distance, density, or neighbor attributes within the system. Development of geospatial analytics permits contextual extraction and investigator-initiated eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) analysis across multiple attributes. Results: We built a unique geospatial big data ecosystem called GeoARK. Analytics on this big table occur across resolution groups, sources, and geographies for extraction and analysis of information to gain new insights. Case studies, including telehealth assessment in North Carolina, national income inequality and health outcome disparity, and a Missouri COVID-19 risk assessment, demonstrate the capability to support robust and efficient geospatial understanding of a wide spectrum of population health questions. Conclusions: This research identified, compiled, transformed, standardized, and integrated multifaceted data required to better understand the context of health events within a large location-enabled database. The GeoARK system empowers health professionals to engage more complex research where the synergisms of health and geospatial information will be robustly studied beyond what could be accomplished today. No longer is the need to know how to perform geospatial processing an impediment to the health researcher, but rather the development of how to think spatially becomes the greater challenge.},

   abstract = {Background: Wearable technology has the potential to improve cardiovascular health monitoring by using machine learning. Such technology enables remote health monitoring and allows for the diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the detection of cardiovascular disease, it can exclude this diagnosis in symptomatic patients, thereby preventing unnecessary hospital visits. In addition, early warning systems can aid cardiologists in timely treatment and prevention. Objective: This study aims to systematically assess the literature on detecting and predicting outcomes of patients with cardiovascular diseases by using machine learning with data obtained from wearables to gain insights into the current state, challenges, and limitations of this technology. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore on September 26, 2020, with no restrictions on the publication date and by using keywords such as ``wearables,'' ``machine learning,'' and ``cardiovascular disease.'' Methodologies were categorized and analyzed according to machine learning–based technology readiness levels (TRLs), which score studies on their potential to be deployed in an operational setting from 1 to 9 (most ready). Results: After the removal of duplicates, application of exclusion criteria, and full-text screening, 55 eligible studies were included in the analysis, covering a variety of cardiovascular diseases. We assessed the quality of the included studies and found that none of the studies were integrated into a health care system (TRL<6), prospective phase 2 and phase 3 trials were absent (TRL<7 and 8), and group cross-validation was rarely used. These issues limited these studies' ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of their methodologies. Furthermore, there seemed to be no agreement on the sample size needed to train these studies' models, the size of the observation window used to make predictions, how long participants should be observed, and the type of machine learning model that is suitable for predicting cardiovascular outcomes. Conclusions: Although current studies show the potential of wearables to monitor cardiovascular events, their deployment as a diagnostic or prognostic cardiovascular clinical tool is hampered by the lack of a realistic data set and proper systematic and prospective evaluation.},

Each of the key steps has been optimized by developing and training new machine-learning models. The sequences from a diverse set of 622 antibody-antigen pairs with known structure were used as inputs for leave-one-out cross validation. The final set of cluster representatives included at least one “Adequate” pose for 550/622 (88.4\\%) of the queries. The median (IQR) ranks of these “Adequate” poses were 22 (5 to 77). Similar results were obtained on a holdout set of 100 unrelated antibody-antigen pairs. When epitopes were re-predicted using docking-derived features for specific antibodies, the median ROC AUC increased from 0.679 to 0.720 in cross validation and from 0.694 to 0.730 in the holdout set.AbAdapt is available at https://sysimm.org/abadapt/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online.},

   abstract = {Leveraging prior viral genome sequencing data to make predictions on whether an unknown, emergent virus harbors a phenotype-of-concern has been a long-sought goal of genomic epidemiology. A predictive phenotype model built from nucleotide-level information alone has previously been considered un-tenable with respect to RNA viruses due to the ultra-high intra-sequence variance of their genomes, even within closely related clades. Building from our prior work developing a degenerate k-mer method to accommodate this high intra-sequence variation of RNA virus genomes for modeling frameworks, and leveraging a taxonomic group-shuffle-split paradigm on complete coronavirus assemblies from prior to October 2018, we trained multiple regularized logistic regression classifiers at the nucleotide k-mer level capable of accurately predicting withheld SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences as human pathogens and accurately predicting withheld Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) genome sequences as non-human pathogens. LASSO feature selection identified several degenerate nucleotide predictor motifs with high model coefficients for the human pathogen class that were present across widely disparate classes of coronaviruses. However, these motifs differed in which genes they were present in, what specific codons were used to encode them, and what the translated amino acid motif was. This emphasizes the importance of a phenetic view of emerging pathogenic RNA viruses, as opposed to the canonical phylogenetic interpretations most-commonly used to track and manage viral zoonoses. Applying our model to more recent Orthocoronavirinae genomes deposited since October 2018 yields a novel contextual view of pathogen-potential across bat-related, canine-related, porcine-related, and rodent-related coronaviruses and critical adaptations which may have contributed to the emergence of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, we discuss the utility of these predictive models (and their associated predictor motifs) to novel biosurveillance protocols that substantially increase the pound-for-pound information content of field-collected sequencing data and make a strong argument for the necessity of routine collection and sequencing of zoonotic viruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors are both employed by MRIGlobal.

   abstract = {Covid-19 is a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given the seriousness of the situation, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic as the Covid-19 rapidly around the world. Among its applications, chest X-ray images are frequently used for an early diagnostic/screening of Covid-19 disease, given the frequent pulmonary impact in the patients, critical issue to prevent further complications caused by this highly infectious disease. In this work, we propose 4 fully automatic approaches for the classification of chest X-ray images under the analysis of 3 different categories: Covid-19, pneumonia and healthy cases. Given the similarity between the pathological impact in the lungs between Covid-19 and pneumonia, mainly during the initial stages of both lung diseases, we performed an exhaustive study of differentiation considering different pathological scenarios. To address these classification tasks, we evaluated 6 representative state-of-the-art deep network architectures on 3 different public datasets: (I) Chest X-ray dataset of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA); (II) Covid-19 Image Data Collection; (III) SIRM dataset of the Italian Society of Medical Radiology. To validate the designed approaches, several representative experiments were performed using 6,070 chest X-ray radiographs. In general, satisfactory results were obtained from the designed approaches, reaching a global accuracy values of 0.9706 ± 0.0044, 0.9839 ± 0.0102, 0.9744 ± 0.0104 and 0.9744 ± 0.0104, respectively, thus helping the work of clinicians in the diagnosis and consequently in the early treatment of this relevant pandemic pathology.},

   abstract = {It is well known that the new coronavirus pandemic has global environmental, public health, and economic implications. In this sense, this study aims to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in the largest wastewater treatment plant of Goiânia, which processes wastewater from more than 700,000 inhabitants, and to correlate the molecular and clinical data collected. Influent and effluent samples were collected at Dr. Helio de Seixo Britto’s wastewater treatment plant from January to August 2021. Viral concentration was performed with polyethylene glycol before viral RNA extraction. Real-time qPCR (N1 and N2 gene assays) was performed to detect and quantify the viral RNA present in the samples. The results showed that 43.63% of the samples were positive. There is no significant difference between the detection of primers N1 (mean 3.23 log10 genome copies/L, std 0.23) and N2 (mean 2.95 log10 genome copies/L, std 0.29); also, there is no significant difference between the detection of influent and effluent samples. Our molecular data revealed a positive correlation with clinical data, and infection prevalence was higher than clinical data. In addition, we developed a user-friendly web application to predict the number of infected people based on the detection of viral load present in wastewater samples and may be applied as a public policy strategy for monitoring ongoing outbreaks.},

   abstract = {The development of new drugs is a very complex and time-consuming process, and for this reason, researchers have been resorting heavily to drug repurposing techniques as an alternative for the treatment of various diseases. This approach is especially interesting when it comes to emerging diseases with high rates of infection, because the lack of a quickly cure brings many human losses until the mitigation of the epidemic, as is the case of COVID-19. In this work, we combine an in-house developed machine learning strategy with docking, MM-PBSA calculations, and metadynamics to detect potential inhibitors for SARS-COV-2 main protease among FDA approved compounds. To assess the ability of our machine learning strategy to retrieve potential compounds we calculated the Enrichment Factor of compound datasets for three well known protein targets: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (PDB 4B3P), 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (PDB 6A94), and H1 histamine receptor (PDB 3RZE). The Enrichment Factor for each target was, respectively, 102.5, 12.4, 10.6, which are considered significant values. Regarding the identification of molecules that can potentially inhibit the main protease of SARS-COV-2, compounds output by the machine learning step went through a docking experiment against SARS-COV-2 Mpro. The best scored poses were the input for MM-PBSA calculations and metadynamics using CHARMM and AMBER force fields to predict the binding energy for each complex. Our work points out six molecules, highlighting the strong interaction obtained for Mpro-mirabegron complex. Among these six, to the best of our knowledge, ambenonium has not yet been described in the literature as a candidate inhibitor for the SARS-COV-2 main protease in its active pocket.},

   abstract = {The present research focuses in the comparison of two social robot models running the same Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications targeting the context of music education for children aged 9-11, with the objective of underlying the design choices favored by the target audience on the running tasks. The Guitar Tuner consists of two main functionalities: tuning process and performance evaluation, which we implemented using the NAO and Zenbo robots. User evaluation included 20 children and assessed their perceived robot embodiment preferences (e.g., shape, robot motion, displays, and emotional expressivity) and perceived usability aspects. The evaluation used an experimental remote protocol supporting collecting online feedback with users during the COVID-19 pandemic. Empirical results supported performing quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the HRI application and highlighting the perceived differences of robot embodiment features. The discussions center on improving a future version of the HRI application, plus children’s considerations about their preferred robot embodiment features during the observation sessions. Finally, we propose recommendations for robot embodiment design for children and learning based on this case study and discuss protocol limitations during the social distancing context, that we believe as a valid alternative to move forward with experimental designs, particularly in robotics, becoming a great contribution to other researchers facing similar hurdles.},

   abstract = {With the widespread use of learning analytics (LA), ethical concerns about fairness have been raised. Research shows that LA models may be biased against students of certain demographic subgroups. Although fairness has gained significant attention in the broader machine learning (ML) community in the last decade, it is only recently that attention has been paid to fairness in LA. Furthermore, the decision on which unfairness mitigation algorithm or metric to use in a particular context remains largely unknown. On this premise, we performed a comparative evaluation of some selected unfairness mitigation algorithms regarded in the fair ML community to have shown promising results. Using a 3-year program dropout data from an Australian university, we comparatively evaluated how the unfairness mitigation algorithms contribute to ethical LA by testing for some hypotheses across fairness and performance metrics. Interestingly, our results show how data bias does not always necessarily result in predictive bias. Perhaps not surprisingly, our test for fairness-utility tradeoff shows how ensuring fairness does not always lead to drop in utility. Indeed, our results show that ensuring fairness might lead to enhanced utility under specific circumstances. Our findings may to some extent, guide fairness algorithm and metric selection for a given context. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic LA is increasingly being used to leverage actionable insights about students and drive student success. LA models have been found to make discriminatory decisions against certain student demographic subgroups—therefore, raising ethical concerns. Fairness in education is nascent. Only a few works have examined fairness in LA and consequently followed up with ensuring fair LA models. What this paper adds A juxtaposition of unfairness mitigation algorithms across the entire LA pipeline showing how they compare and how each of them contributes to fair LA. Ensuring ethical LA does not always lead to a dip in performance. Sometimes, it actually improves performance as well. Fairness in LA has only focused on some form of outcome equality, however equality of outcome may be possible only when the playing field is levelled. Implications for practice and/or policy Based on desired notion of fairness and which segment of the LA pipeline is accessible, a fairness-minded decision maker may be able to decide which algorithm to use in order to achieve their ethical goals. LA practitioners can carefully aim for more ethical LA models without trading significant utility by selecting algorithms that find the right balance between the two objectives. Fairness enhancing technologies should be cautiously used as guides—not final decision makers. Human domain experts must be kept in the loop to handle the dynamics of transcending fair LA beyond equality to equitable LA.},

   abstract = {Health concerns during the Covid-19 pandemic required the adaptation of a lecture-laboratory course in ultrasound imaging for graduate students from an in-person to a live, remote learning format. The adaptation of in-person lectures to live, remote delivery was achieved by using videoconferencing. The adaptation of in-person laboratory sessions to live, remote instruction was achieved in the first half of the course by providing a hand-held ultrasound instrument to each student who performed self-scanning at their remote locations, while the instructor provided live instruction using videoconferencing. In the second half of the course, the students transitioned to using cart-based, hospital-type instruments and self-scanning in the ultrasound laboratory on campus. The aim of this study was to measure the success of this adaptation to the course by comparing assessment scores of students in the live, remote course with assessment scores of students in the in-person course offered in the previous year. There were no statistically significant differences in the assessment scores of students in the two courses. The adaptation of a course in ultrasound imaging from an in-person to a live, remote learning format during the Covid-19 pandemic described here suggests that contrary to the prevailing view, ultrasound imaging can be taught to students without in-person instruction. The adapted course can serve as a model for teaching ultrasound where instructors and learners are physically separated by constraints other than health concerns during a pandemic.},

   abstract = {Objectives Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a heavily underdiagnosed condition, which can lead to significant multimorbidity. Underdiagnosis is often secondary to limitations in existing diagnostic methods. We conducted a diagnostic accuracy and usability study, to evaluate the efficacy of a novel, low-cost, small, wearable medical device, AcuPebble_SA100, for automated diagnosis of OSA in the home environment. Settings Patients were recruited to a standard OSA diagnostic pathway in an UK hospital. They were trained on the use of type-III-cardiorespiratory polygraphy, which they took to use at home. They were also given AcuPebble_SA100; but they were not trained on how to use it. Participants 182 consecutive patients had been referred for OSA diagnosis in which 150 successfully completed the study. Primary outcome measures Efficacy of AcuPebble_SA100 for automated diagnosis of moderate-severe-OSA against cardiorespiratory polygraphy (sensitivity/specificity/likelihood ratios/predictive values) and validation of usability by patients themselves in their home environment. Results After returning the systems, two expert clinicians, blinded to AcuPebble_SA100's output, manually scored the cardiorespiratory polygraphy signals to reach a diagnosis. AcuPebble_SA100 generated automated diagnosis corresponding to four, typically followed, diagnostic criteria: Apnoea Hypopnoea Index (AHI) using 3% as criteria for oxygen desaturation; Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) for 3% and 4% desaturation criteria and AHI using 4% as desaturation criteria. In all cases, AcuPebble_SA100 matched the experts' diagnosis with positive and negative likelihood ratios over 10 and below 0.1, respectively. Comparing against the current American Academy of Sleep Medicine's AHI-based criteria demonstrated 95.33% accuracy (95% CI (90·62% to 98·10%)), 96.84% specificity (95% CI (91·05% to 99·34%)), 92.73% sensitivity (95% CI (82·41% to 97·98%)), 94.4% positive-predictive value (95% CI (84·78% to 98·11%)) and 95.83% negative-predictive value (95% CI (89·94% to 98·34%)). All patients used AcuPebble_SA100 correctly. Over 97% reported a strong preference for AcuPebble_SA100 over cardiorespiratory polygraphy. Conclusions These results validate the efficacy of AcuPebble_SA100 as an automated diagnosis alternative to cardiorespiratory polygraphy; also demonstrating that AcuPebble_SA100 can be used by patients without requiring human training/assistance. This opens the doors for more efficient patient pathways for OSA diagnosis. Trial registration number NCT03544086; ClinicalTrials.gov.},

Here, we investigate two frameworks, published in March 2020 and November 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) to categorise transmission risks of COVID-19 infection, and assess how well the countries’ self-reported classification tracked their underlying epidemiological situation. We used three modelling approaches: an ordinal longitudinal model, a proportional odds model and a machine learning One-Rule classification algorithm. We applied these models to 202 countries’ daily transmission classification and epidemiological data, and study classification accuracy over time for the period April 2020 to June 2021, when WHO stopped publishing country classifications. Overall, the first published WHO classification, purely qualitative, lacked accuracy. The incidence rate within the previous 14 days was the best predictor with an average accuracy throughout the period of study of 61.5%. However, when each week was assessed independently, the models returned predictive accuracies above 50% only in the first weeks of April 2020. In contrast, the second classification, quantitative in nature, increased significantly the accuracy of transmission labels, with values as high as 94%.},

   abstract = {Online customer reviews (OCR) are an established source of competitive intelligence. Since OCR reflect perceptions of past users about product features and performance, prospective customers of mobile apps often resort to OCR before they decide to download an app. In addition to the textual content of the OCR, potential users of the app often consult the star ratings provided by the reviewers. In this paper, we determine if the star rating of mobile payment apps suitably captures the appropriate customer perception reflected in the textual content of the OCR for the payment apps. We conduct a three-dimensional analysis of 146,914 reviews from two popular mobile payment apps and uncover the sentiment and emotions captured in the review text, and the reactions in the emojis. Our analysis shows that the consolidated sentiment and the happiness emotion obtained from the OCR of mobile payment apps impacts the star ratings more strongly, than other emotions embedded in the text, and reactions in the emojis. The findings also hold good during the Covid-19 pandemic. We propose a novel perception score that captures the nuances in the OCR more effectively and suggest how mobile app providers can use it to arrange the OCR for better compatibility with content. The results of this research will be useful for mobile app providers that depend on OCR for popularizing their apps and will provide them a novel metric based on content, that can leverage OCR better to influence future downloads.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Over the last 2 years, the artificial intelligence (AI) community has presented several automatic screening tools for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on chest radiography (CXR), with reported accuracies often well over 90%. However, it has been noted that many of these studies have likely suffered from dataset bias, leading to overly optimistic results. The purpose of this study was to thoroughly investigate to what extent biases have influenced the performance of a range of previously proposed and promising convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and to determine what performance can be expected with current CNNs on a realistic and unbiased dataset. Methods: Five CNNs for COVID-19 positive/negative classification were implemented for evaluation, namely VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and COVID-Net. To perform both internal and cross-dataset evaluations, four datasets were created. The first dataset Valencian Region Medical Image Bank (BIMCV) followed strict reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test criteria and was created from a single reliable open access databank, while the second dataset (COVIDxB8) was created through a combination of six online CXR repositories. The third and fourth datasets were created by combining the opposing classes from the BIMCV and COVIDxB8 datasets. To decrease inter-dataset variability, a pre-processing workflow of resizing, normalization, and histogram equalization were applied to all datasets. Classification performance was evaluated on unseen test sets using precision and recall. A qualitative sanity check was performed by evaluating saliency maps displaying the top 5%, 10%, and 20% most salient segments in the input CXRs, to evaluate whether the CNNs were using relevant information for decision making. In an additional experiment and to further investigate the origin of potential dataset bias, all pixel values outside the lungs were set to zero through automatic lung segmentation before training and testing. Results: When trained and evaluated on the single online source dataset (BIMCV), the performance of all CNNs is relatively low (precision: 0.65–0.72, recall: 0.59–0.71), but remains relatively consistent during external evaluation (precision: 0.58–0.82, recall: 0.57–0.72). On the contrary, when trained and internally evaluated on the combinatory datasets, all CNNs performed well across all metrics (precision: 0.94–1.00, recall: 0.77–1.00). However, when subsequently evaluated cross-dataset, results dropped substantially (precision: 0.10–0.61, recall: 0.04–0.80). For all datasets, saliency maps revealed the CNNs rarely focus on areas inside the lungs for their decision-making. However, even when setting all pixel values outside the lungs to zero, classification performance does not change and dataset bias remains. Conclusions: Results in this study confirm that when trained on a combinatory dataset, CNNs tend to learn the origin of the CXRs rather than the presence or absence of disease, a behavior known as short-cut learning. The bias is shown to originate from differences in overall pixel values rather than embedded text or symbols, despite consistent image pre-processing. When trained on a reliable, and realistic single-source dataset in which non-lung pixels have been masked, CNNs currently show limited sensitivity (<70%) for COVID-19 infection in CXR, questioning their use as a reliable automatic screening tool.},

Consequently, implementing AI systems in healthcare can enable the optimisation of healthcare resources, facilitate a better patient experience, improve population health, reduce per capita costs, and improve the satisfaction of health professionals. Nowadays, most studies have focused on the potential benefits and barriers to implementing AI in healthcare, while only a few have explained the rational decision-making process for deploying new technologies in the healthcare system. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by investigating how AI supports the effective and efficient management of the healthcare system by examining the Humber River Hospital in Toronto using the case study methodology. To achieve the desired benefits from the process of implementing technology in healthcare, our key findings show that hospitals need to undergo a business transformation that exploits technology.

To model such graph-structured data, graph learning, in particular deep graph learning with graph neural networks, has drawn much attention in both academic and industrial communities lately. Prevailing graph learning methods usually rely on learning from "big'' data, requiring a large amount of labeled data for model training. However, it is common that graphs are associated with "small'' labeled data as data annotation and labeling on graphs is always time and resource-consuming. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate graph learning with minimal human supervision for the low-resource settings where limited or even no labeled data is available. In this tutorial, we will focus on the state-of-the-art techniques of Graph Minimally-supervised Learning, in particular a series of weakly-supervised learning, few-shot learning, and self-supervised learning methods on graph-structured data as well as their real-world applications. The objectives of this tutorial are to: (1) formally categorize the problems in graph minimally-supervised learning and discuss the challenges under different learning scenarios; (2) comprehensively review the existing and recent advances of graph minimally-supervised learning; and (3) elucidate open questions and future research directions. This tutorial introduces major topics within minimally-supervised learning and offers a guide to a new frontier of graph learning. We believe this tutorial is beneficial to researchers and practitioners, allowing them to collaborate on graph learning.},

In this paper, a practical robotic system is developed to provide intelligent support for older persons using a wheeled mobile manipulator (WMM), consisting of an omnidirectional mobile platform and a robotic arm. We focus on two critical needs: (1) mobility assistance, and (2) object manipulation support. The tasks are not executed simultaneously and each uses a task-dependent end-effector. Learning from demonstration, or kinesthetic teaching, is adopted to help the WMM to learn an elderly or disabled user's walking pattern or an able-bodied person's object manipulation skill. The robotic system can assist the user in conducting a number of daily operations. For mobility assistance, the WMM is reconfigured into a smart walker, where a novel variable admittance control is adopted to detect the user's walking intention. A learning approach based on dynamic movement primitives is implemented to capture and adapt the WMM to the user's walking pattern. For object manipulation support, a demonstrator first collaborates with an elderly user to conduct the task, and then the WMM takes the role of the demonstrator to assist the user. The Gaussian mixture model and Gaussian mixture regression are used to learn and reproduce the demonstrator's experience, respectively. The advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach are experimentally demonstrated with a four-wheel omnidirectional WMM.},

   abstract = {The coupled human-Earth system is comprised of interacting influences between socioeconomic and natural systems, where changes in one system can induce cascading feedbacks. The pathways of future change in these systems are highly uncertain, as is the structure of their interdependencies. To contend with this ambiguity, this dissertation seeks to advance metrics and frameworks to aid robust planning in human-natural systems that can withstand changes in underlying assumptions. To this end, the second and third chapter employ a model that represents the integration of the economic, climate, land, energy, and water systems to simulate thousands of plausible future scenarios. Statistical or machine learning techniques are then used to discover the drivers of impacts of water and land scarcity, respectively. Chapter 2 introduces a metric of the economic impact of water scarcity based on the change in total economic surplus of water markets between a world with unlimited water and one with physical constraints imposed on water supply. The finding that basins can experience both highly positive and severely negative impacts depending on comparative advantage emphasizes the importance of considering metrics that capture multi-sector dynamics, while the heterogeneity of drivers of impact across regions shows that influential factors should not be presumed in complex systems. Chapter 3 examines changes in water withdrawals, carbon emissions, food prices, and food production due to imposing constraints on available land. Constraints are imposed on the demand side through biofuel mandates and the supply side through a land conservation policy. Using multiple metrics of impact allows for the investigation of tradeoffs between metrics and how these tradeoffs are amplified based on regional or scenario assumptions. Finally, Chapter 4 focuses on estimating the mean of highly skewed and heavy tailed data. Data with these characteristics are common in complex systems such as the human-Earth system. Decision-making (e.g., through expected utility analysis) often relies on estimating the mean of a dataset. This chapter demonstrates the error that can occur by using the sample mean in such situations and recommends a preferable estimator that is more robust to changes in the underlying model assumptions. Overall, this thesis provides examples of robust approaches to address critical challenges in the highly uncertain complex human-Earth system.},

   abstract = {Background: Family caregivers of children and youth with severe neurodisabilities that require chronic respiratory management often report a compromised quality of life. In this cross-sectional study, we used DeYoung’s (Psychol Inq 21(1): 26–33, 2010. https://doi.org/10.1080/10478401003648674) conceptualization of two personality metatraits, Alpha and Beta, to test their theorized role in facilitating resilience among these family caregivers. We expected higher Alpha and Beta would exhibit direct, beneficial effects on caregiver mental and physical health quality of life (QoL), and they would operate through self-reported resilience and coping to exert positive, indirect effects on caregiver QoL. Methods: Family caregivers of children and youth at an outpatient chronic respiratory management clinic were informed of the study. Of the 68 who consented, 61 provided complete data on measures of personality traits, coping styles, and physical and mental health-related QoL. Factor analytic techniques verified the two personality metatraits, consistent with the DeYoung model. The metatraits were then used as predictor variables in a path model to predict physical and mental health-related QoL. Self-reported resilience and a coping variable were examined as possible mediators of the personality-QoL relationship. Results: Correlational analyses isolated a coping variable that met criteria as a possible mediator. The path model exhibited good fit to the data. The Alpha metatrait—characterized by emotional stability, self-regulation, perseverance, and intrinsic motivation—was directly predictive of caregiver mental health. The Beta metatrait, reflecting a disposition for adaptive flexibility, responsiveness, and interpersonal initiative, demonstrated significant indirect effects to physical and mental health through its positive association with coping efforts to maintain social support and a sense of self. Conclusions: Consistent with DeYoung’s conceptualization, higher Alpha and Beta predicted caregiver resilience, albeit through different pathways. The emotional stability, perseverance and emotional regulation associated with Alpha likely accounted for its positive association with caregiver mental health. Beta, in contrast, may operate through their adaptive flexibility, personal resourcefulness and social engagement to augment coping efforts that involve others and support family activities, which, in turn, promote their own physical and mental health. Limitations of the cross-sectional design, and potential theoretical and clinical implications of the personality metatraits and their relation to resilience are discussed.},

   abstract = {The proportion of elderly people in society is predicted to continue to rise in the coming decades. Mobility is a key aspect of many daily activities, but falls become an increasingly significant health risk with age. With the COVID-19 pandemic, many elderly users prefer or require assistive devices, rather than human support, in walking and carrying out daily tasks. However, prior work has shown that when using passive assistive mobility devices, fall risks can actually increase. This presents an opportunity for assistive robots to help maintain and improve the mobility of elderly users, with an additional emphasis on safety, made possible through sensing capabilities. In this paper, we present a computer vision system that detects the eye blink and face angle patterns for exhibiting signs of tiredness. In addition to the frame-based detection, we also introduce a time-window collation with a machine learning classifier. The system proposed here is critical in monitoring the user, performing real-time detection, and recommending they take a break if tiredness is detected. The overall system architecture and algorithmic details are presented, then a series of experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the approach.},

In Israel, from the beginning of the pandemic, all universities and colleges quickly adopted an online education system, while the other educational systems did similarly, in part or in full. This study examines the impact of the involuntary immersion of students and instructors into digital learning environments due to the COVID-19 pandemic – the impact on the pedagogical practices, pedagogical conceptions, and inclinations toward pedagogical change of university and college instructors during the “Corona Related Teaching Situation” (CRTS). Our research followed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative with quantitative components. The explanatory design is a two-phase mixed methods–approach design, which began with the collection and analysis of quantitative data and was followed by the subsequent collection and analysis of qualitative data. The current report places special emphasis on the qualitative components of the research. The major contribution of this article is the development of a typology based on a conceptual model that allows for the identification of three teacher profiles that emerged during the CRTS: Experienced teachers, Enthusiastic teachers, and Cautious teachers. The study found that the main variable affecting a teacher’s fit into one of these profiles is the level of digital literacy before the crisis. Our typology can be applied to different crisis situations and can be useful for the training and development of university teachers in the field of digital literacy.},

Although working memory and attention are intertwined, several studies have recently shown that individual differences in the general ability to control attention is more strongly predictive of human behavior than working memory capacity. In this review, we argue that researchers would therefore generally be better suited to studying the role of attention control rather than memory-based abilities in explaining real-world behavior and performance in humans. The review begins with a discussion of relevant literature on the nature and measurement of both working memory capacity and attention control, including recent developments in the study of individual differences of attention control. We then selectively review existing literature on the role of both working memory and attention in various applied settings and explain, in each case, why a switch in emphasis to attention control is warranted. Topics covered include psychological testing, cognitive training, education, sports, police decision-making, human factors, and disorders within clinical psychology. The review concludes with general recommendations and best practices for researchers interested in conducting studies of individual differences in attention control.},

Leveraging a large collection of both tweets (N = 1,657,551) and news stories (N = 50,356) about the early COVID-19 pandemic, we employed bot detection techniques, structural topic modeling, and time series analysis to characterize the temporal associations between the topics Twitter bots tend to amplify and subsequent news coverage across the partisan spectrum. We found that bots represented 8.98% of total accounts, selectively promoted certain topics and predicted coverage aligned with partisan narratives.

It begins with their methodologies, identifying numerous commonalities in their post-Marxian frameworks. The substance of their theories is then examined, where it is shown that both plausibly explain contemporary social reality in terms of the interplay of three forces: the information technology revolution, the restructuring of capitalism and the innovational role of culture. There are found to be major similarities in their accounts (the Kantian interpretation, social stratification) but also significant divergences (role of science, the fourth world, the normative content of culture). Suitably combined, Bell’s and Castells’s thought goes a long way towards delivering a persuasive sociological theory of the global information society. However, the article concludes by suggesting that extensive further work is needed to clarify the precise relationships between the three factors and their relative weightings in the equations required to explain recent social change.},

   abstract = {With the SARS-CoV-2's exponential growth, intelligent and constructive practice is required to diagnose the COVID-19. The rapid spread of the virus and the shortage of reliable testing models are considered major issues in detecting COVID-19. This problem remains the peak burden for clinicians. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in image processing, the burden of diagnosing the COVID-19 cases has been reduced to acceptable thresholds. But traditional AI techniques often require centralized data storage and training for the predictive model development which increases the computational complexity. The real-world challenge is to exchange data globally across hospitals while also taking into account of the organizations' privacy concerns. Collaborative model development and privacy protection are critical considerations while training a global deep learning model. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on blockchain and the federated learning model. The federated learning model takes care of reduced complexity, and blockchain helps in distributed data with privacy maintained. More precisely, the proposed federated learning ensembled deep five learning blockchain model (FLED-Block) framework collects the data from the different medical healthcare centers, develops the model with the hybrid capsule learning network, and performs the prediction accurately, while preserving the privacy and shares among authorized persons. Extensive experimentation has been carried out using the lung CT images and compared the performance of the proposed model with the existing VGG-16 and 19, Alexnets, Resnets-50 and 100, Inception V3, Densenets-121, 119, and 150, Mobilenets, SegCaps in terms of accuracy (98.2%), precision (97.3%), recall (96.5%), specificity (33.5%), and F1-score (97%) in predicting the COVID-19 with effectively preserving the privacy of the data among the heterogeneous users.},

   abstract = {Since the declaration of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, health systems/ health-care-workers globally have been overwhelmed by a vast number of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. During the early stages of the pandemic, the lack of formalized evidence-based guidelines in all aspects of patient management was a significant challenge. Coupled with a lack of effective pharmacotherapies resulted in unsatisfactory outcomes in ICU patients. The anticipated increment in ICU surge capacity was staggering, with almost every ICU worldwide being advised to increase their capacity to allow adequate care provision in response to multiple waves of the pandemic. This increase in surge capacity required advanced planning and reassessments at every stage, taking advantage of experienced gained in combination with emerging evidence. In University Hospital Southampton General Intensive Care Unit (GICU), despite the initial lack of national and international guidance, we enhanced our ICU capacity and developed local guidance on all aspects of care to address the rapid demand from the increasing COVID-19 admissions. The main element of this success was a multidisciplinary team approach intertwined with equipment and infrastructural reorganization. This narrative review provides an insight into the approach adopted by our center to manage patients with COVID-19 critical illness, exploring the initial planning process, including contingency preparations to accommodate (360% capacity increment) and adaptation of our management pathways as more evidence emerged throughout the pandemic to provide the most appropriate levels of care to our patients. We hope our experience will benefit other intensive care units worldwide. This article is categorized under: Infectious Diseases > Genetics/Genomics/Epigenetics.},

A decision support system (DSS) is an intelligent system that provides improved assistance in various stages of health-related disease diagnosis. At the same time, the SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes COVID-19 disease has spread globally from the beginning of 2020. Several research works reported that the imaging pattern based on computed tomography (CT) can be utilized to detect SARS-CoV-2. Earlier identification and detection of the diseases is essential to offer adequate treatment and avoid the severity of the disease. With this motivation, this study develops an efficient deep-learning-based fusion model with swarm intelligence (EDLFM-SI) for SARS-CoV-2 identification. The proposed EDLFM-SI technique aims to detect and classify the SARS-CoV-2 infection or not. Also, the EDLFM-SI technique comprises various processes, namely, data augmentation, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Moreover, a fusion of capsule network (CapsNet) and MobileNet based feature extractors are employed. Besides, a water strider algorithm (WSA) is applied to fine-tune the hyperparameters involved in the DL models. Finally, a cascaded neural network (CNN) classifier is applied for detecting the existence of SARS-CoV-2. In order to showcase the improved performance of the EDLFM-SI technique, a wide range of simulations take place on the COVID-19 CT data set and the SARS-CoV-2 CT scan data set. The simulation outcomes highlighted the supremacy of the EDLFM-SI technique over the recent approaches.},

   abstract = {Manufacturers, especially SMEs, are increasingly adopting digitalization to improve their agility to respond to the fluctuating market dynamics and to be transparent. To achieve sustained competitiveness, SMEs are shedding their reluctance to invest in technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics. Further, Manufacturing Execution System (MES) can serve as the intelligence hub, integrating product lifecycle with manufacturing, augmenting the IoT investments to orchestrate their facilities to be aligned to deliver what the customer needs. MES is a pivotal function integrating virtual and physical worlds and that makes it worthy of deeper examination. Integrated Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) is the evolved state of standalone MES, and it consolidates production processes to facilitate quality management, scheduling, manufacturing execution and more. The motivation of this research is to study the potential barriers of implementing MOM/MES that reduces its effectiveness and it has three goals. Firstly, the current knowledge associated with MOM/MES needs to be examined to derive its relevance, functions and benefits. Secondly, potential barriers of MOM/MES are to be identified that can reduce its effectiveness. Thirdly, approaches need to be established to overcome the barriers and improve the overall value of the initiative. SMEs cannot afford delayed returns on their digital investments; therefore, it is crucial to mitigate the barriers of implementing MOM/MES. This study resulted in calling attention to five barriers and its corresponding mitigations - constructive closed-loop, cross-functional integration, flexible operations orchestrations, high-availability cloud connection and insightful data contextualization. Most barriers discussed in the past studies can be classified as readiness related, i.e. funding, expertise, compatibility, priority, capacity, security, whereas the barriers discussed in this research paper are directly related to implementation. Knowing the barriers and its mitigation approaches, manufacturers can now pre-empt measures to neutralize the challenges and make MOM/MES adoptions successful.},

This review aims to identify the role of IoMT applications in improving healthcare system and to analyze the status of research demonstrating effectiveness of IoMT benefits to the patient and healthcare system along with a brief insight into technologies supplementing IoMT and challenges faced in developing a smart healthcare system. An internet-based search in PUBMED, Google Scholar and IEEE Library for english language publications using relevant terms resulted in 987 articles. After screening title, abstract, and content related to IoMT in healthcare and excluding duplicate articles, 135 articles published in journal with impact factor ≥1 were eligible for inclusion. Also relevant articles from the references of the selected articles were considered. The habituation of IoMT and related technology has resolved several difficulties using remote monitoring, telemedicine, robotics, sensors etc. However mass adoption seems challenging due to factors like privacy and security of data, management of large amount of data, scalability and upgradation etc. Although ample knowledge has been compiled and exchanged, this structured systematic review will help the healthcare practitioners, policymakers/decision makers, scientists and researchers to gauge the applicability of IoMT in healthcare more efficiently.},

Today, at least within the Global North, there is an ever-pressing and omnipresent threat of the next “cyber-attack” or the emergence of a new vulnerability in highly interconnected supply chains. However, such discursive positioning of threat and its resolution has typically reinforced, and perpetuated, dominant power structures and forms of violence as well as universalist protocols of protection. In this collective discussion, in contrast, six scholars from different disciplines discuss what it means to “do” “critical” research into what many of us uncomfortably refer to as “cybersecurity.” In a series of provocations and reflections, we argue that, as much as cybersecurity may be a dominant discursive mode with associated funding and institutional “benefits,” it is crucial to look outward, in conversation with other moves to consider our technological moment. That is, we question who and what cybersecurity is for, how to engage as academics, and what it could mean to undo cybersecurity in ways that can reassess and challenge power structures in the twenty-first century.</p>},

A top-down approach is adopted to construct a financial proxy-based sentiment index completed with sentiment extracted from automobile news and customer reviews. The paper uses a text mining approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices. The study was initially performed at the overall individual stock from the Nifty Auto NSE but focused on the top three passenger vehicle manufacturing companies i.e., Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Eicher. It was found that the sentiment index was augmented with news and customer reviews allows predicting more accurately NIFTY AUTO stock price movements. This implies that customer sentiment is a major driver of investor sentiment which in turn impacts the stock market and the firm value. Thus, the present study is an integrated approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices.},

After contextualizing each pandemic within its legal, political, and social culture, the analysis distills prevailing principles between the two health crises and their approach to religious liberty. Evidence suggests that courts in both periods relied on proportionality and equality to resolve disputes between government bans on worship services and conscientious objectors. However, the experience of multiple local governments in 1918 and other nations in 2020 models a better way. Instead of using proportionality or equality, these state officials relied on reciprocity between government and religious groups. Their approach tended to produce fewer bans, lower case counts, and greater trust during the pandemic and offers a useful precedent for current US lawmakers managing the religious freedom concerns of COVID-19.},

   abstract = {Background: Uncertainties surrounding the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) remain a major global health challenge and requires attention. Researchers and medical experts have made remarkable efforts to reduce the number of cases and prevent future outbreaks through vaccines and other measures. However, there is little evidence on how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection entropy can be applied in predicting the possible number of infections and deaths. In addition, more studies on how the COVID-19 infection density contributes to the rise in infections are needed. This study demonstrates how the SARS-COV-2 daily infection entropy can be applied in predicting the number of infections within a given period. In addition, the infection density within a given population attributes to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and, consequently, the new variants. Results: Using the COVID-19 initial data reported by Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization (WHO) and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), the result shows that the original SAR-COV-2 strain has R0<1 with an initial infection growth rate entropy of 9.11 bits for the United States (U.S.). At close proximity, the average infection time for an infected individual to infect others within a susceptible population is approximately 7 minutes. Assuming no vaccines were available, in the U.S., the number of infections could range between 41,220,199 and 82,440,398 in late March 2022 with approximately, 1,211,036 deaths. However, with the available vaccines, nearly 48 Million COVID-19 cases and 706, 437 deaths have been prevented. Conclusion: The proposed technique will contribute to the ongoing investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic and a blueprint to address the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic.},

In clinical practice, there is a need for improved plasma biomarker-based tools for diagnosis and risk prediction of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Analysis of blood, to identify plasma proteins with potential utility for such tools, could enable an individualized approach to treatment and prevention. Technological advances to study the plasma proteome on a large scale allows broad screening for the identification of novel plasma biomarkers, both by targeted and nontargeted proteomics methods. However, assay limitations need to be considered when interpreting results, with orthogonal validation required before conclusions are drawn. Here, we review and provide perspectives on the application of affinity- and mass spectrometry-based methods for the identification and analysis of plasma protein biomarkers, with potential application in the field of VTE. We also provide a future perspective on discovery strategies and emerging technologies for targeted proteomics in thrombosis research. Finally, we summarize relevant new data on this topic, presented during the 2021 ISTH Congress.},

   abstract = {Today, the earth planet suffers from the decay of active pandemic COVID-19 which motivates scientists and researchers to detect and diagnose the infected people. Chest X-ray (CXR) image is a common utility tool for detection. Even the CXR suffers from low informative details about COVID-19 patches; the computer vision helps to overcome it through grayscale spatial exploitation analysis. In turn, it is highly recommended to acquire more CXR images to increase the capacity and ability to learn for mining the grayscale spatial exploitation. In this paper, an efficient Gray-scale Spatial Exploitation Net (GSEN) is designed by employing web pages crawling across cloud computing environments. The motivation of this work are i) utilizing a framework methodology for constructing consistent dataset by web crawling to update the dataset continuously per crawling iteration; ii) designing lightweight, fast learning, comparable accuracy, and fine-tuned parameters gray-scale spatial exploitation deep neural net; iii) comprehensive evaluation of the designed gray-scale spatial exploitation net for different collected dataset(s) based on web COVID-19 crawling verse the transfer learning of the pre-trained nets. Different experiments have been performed for benchmarking both the proposed web crawling framework methodology and the designed gray-scale spatial exploitation net. Due to the accuracy metric, the proposed net achieves 95.60% for two-class labels, and 92.67% for three-class labels, respectively compared with the most recent transfer learning Google-Net, VGG-19, Res-Net 50, and Alex-Net approaches. Furthermore, web crawling utilizes the accuracy rates improvement in a positive relationship to the cardinality of crawled CXR dataset.},

   abstract = {Controlling active and passive systems in buildings with the aim of optimizing energy efficiency and maintaining occupants’ comfort is the major task of building management systems. However, most of these systems use a predefined configuration, which usually do not match the occupants’ preferences. Therefore, occupancy detection is imperative for energy use management mainly in residential and industrial buildings. Most works related to data-driven-based occupancy detection have used batch learning techniques, which need to store first and then train the data. It is not appropriate for a non-stationary environment. Therefore, this work sheds more light on the use of non-stationary machine learning techniques. To this end, three machine learning algorithms for stream data processing are presented, tested, and evaluated in term of accuracy and resources performance (i.e., RAM, CPU), with the aim of predicting the number of occupants in smart buildings. A platform architecture that integrates IoT technologies with stream machine learning is implemented and deployed. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this approach and illustrate that the number of occupants can be predicted with an accuracy of more than 83% and without resource wasting (i.e., time of CPU use varied between 0.04s and 3.85 · 10−11 GB of RAM could be exploited per hour).},

AIM: We aimed to develop a reagent-free way to detect COVID-19 in a real-world setting with minimal constraints on sample acquisition. The machine learning (ML) models involved could be frequently updated to include spectral information about variants without needing to develop new reagents. APPROACH: We present a workflow for collecting, preparing, and imaging dried saliva supernatant droplets using a non-invasive, label-free technique-Raman spectroscopy-to detect changes in the molecular profile of saliva associated with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We used an innovative multiple instance learning-based ML approach and droplet segmentation to analyze droplets. Amongst all confounding factors, we discriminated between COVID-positive and COVID-negative individuals yielding receiver operating coefficient curves with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.8 in both males (79% sensitivity and 75% specificity) and females (84% sensitivity and 64% specificity). Taking the sex of the saliva donor into account increased the AUC by 5%. CONCLUSION: These findings may pave the way for new rapid Raman spectroscopic screening tools for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.},

We propose Smart Pooling, a machine learning method that uses clinical and sociodemographic data from patients to increase the efficiency of informed Dorfman testing for COVID-19 by arranging samples into all-negative pools. To do this, we ran an automated method to train numerous machine learning models on a retrospective dataset from more than 8000 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 from April to July 2020 in Bogotá, Colombia. We estimated the efficiency gains of using the predictor to support Dorfman testing by simulating the outcome of tests. We also computed the attainable efficiency gains of non-adaptive pooling schemes mathematically. Moreover, we measured the false-negative error rates in detecting the ORF1ab and N genes of the virus in RT-qPCR dilutions. Finally, we presented the efficiency gains of using our proposed pooling scheme on proof-of-concept pooled tests. We believe Smart Pooling will be efficient for optimizing massive testing of SARS-CoV-2.},

   abstract = {In 2020 during COVID-19, in addition to the spread of coronavirus disease, we also observed a pandemic of disinformation about the disease. This pandemic of disinformation became known as Infodemic in the medical world. Just as coronavirus was infecting our bodies, Infodemic was infecting our information ecosystem and exasperating the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Disinformation can be produced by various sources including scientists, media personalities, and others and it can be disseminated by news media, webpages, and social media from one source to another. Additionally, disinformation can spread easily from web media to social media where it can spread even faster to a wider audience. Therefore, it is important that disinformation be detected before it has a chance to spread. However, the identification of disinformation is fraught with several challenges. This fact highlights the importance of studying and identifying disinformation both in the content of web pages and social media posts before it is allowed to spread. In this dissertation, I pursued a three-essay approach to understand, identify, and mitigate the disinformation pandemic. While manual fact-checking is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, various automated detection solutions could speed up this process. Therefore, in my first essay, I explored whether Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to develop predictive models for automatic identification of disinformation. Computational linguistics methods are used to extract content-based, and sentiment-based features of selected webpage' articles to construct our study dataset. This dataset is used to train various ML algorithms to develop predictive models to identify disinformation. The results showed that there are significant differences among features of true and false information that can be used to identify disinformation. Since the spread of disinformation happens both on media pages and on socialmedia platforms, it is important to analyze disinformation at both levels. Moreover, the literature shows that disinformation spreads six times faster than true information on social media, demonstrating that users get more engaged with disinformation. Therefore, I extended my research to enhance the understanding of disinformation detection based on content-based features and its impact on users' engagement in social media posts. The findings of the second essay highlighted the critical role of linguistic structure, emotional tone, and the psychological load of social media posts on users' engagement that can be used to differentiate information from disinformation. The results of the first two essays confirmed that negative emotional tone was one of the most important factors in disinformation posts and was associated with a high engagement score. So, in the third essay, I explore the impact of negative emotional tones in developing users' perceptions regarding the accuracy of the content. Three separate experiments were developed to explore this. The results of experiments in the third essay highlighted the significant role of negative emotional tones on the believability of the content and their potential influence on behavioral change. My research findings allow for a better understanding and identification of disinformation by highlighting and identifying content-based features that are meant to mislead users to falsely perceive disinformation as information.},

With the potential to lead individuals to harmful decisions for the society, this infodemic represents a severe threat to information security, public health and democracy. In this paper, we assess the interplay between the infodemic and specific aspects of the pandemic, such as the number of cases, the strictness of containment measures, and the news media coverage. We perform a comparative study on three countries that employed different managements of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020—namely Italy, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. We first analyze the three countries from an epidemiological perspective to characterize the impact of the pandemic and the strictness of the restrictions adopted. Then, we collect a total of 6 million posts from Facebook to describe user news consumption behaviors with respect to the reliability of such posts. Finally, we quantify the relationship between the number of posts published in each of the three countries and the number of confirmed cases, the strictness of the restrictions adopted, and the online news media coverage about the pandemic. Our results show that posts referring to reliable sources are consistently predominant in the news circulation, and that users engage more with reliable posts rather than with posts referring to questionable sources. Furthermore, our modelling results suggest that factors related to the epidemiological and informational ecosystems can serve as proxies to assess the evolution of the infodemic.},

The production of the high number of satellites involved in modern mega-constellations is bringing in the space industry the necessity of improved and optimized manufacturing approaches suitable for serial production, i.e., standard environment/high number of platforms. In this framework, the adoption of Industry 4.0 methodologies within the space industry will lead to a significant improvement and optimization of the whole Manufacturing Assembly Integration and Testing (MAIT) cycle. The main aim of Industry 4.0 is the creation of intelligent factories where manufacturing technologies are upgraded and transformed by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics with predictive monitoring features. Main element of the Industry 4.0 approach is the synergic use of embedded sensing technologies in the frame of intelligent production processes, fostering a radical evolution of the industrial values chains, production value chains, and business models. In the present work, a possible application of the Industry 4.0 concepts to space industry is presented and discussed in terms of applicability and obtainable advantages. As a case study, the composite sandwich panel manufacturing line of RUAG Space is considered.

   abstract = {The main aim of this study was to identify the most relevant cytokines which, when assessed in the earliest stages from hospital admission, may help to select COVID-19 patients with worse prognosis. A retrospective observational study was conducted in 415 COVID-19 patients (272 males; mean age 68 ± 14 years) hospitalized between May 2020 and March 2021. Within the first 72 h from hospital admission, patients were tested for a large panel of biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), Mid-regional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), Interferon-γ, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, soluble IL2-receptor-α (sIL2Rα), IP10 and TNFα. Extensive statistical analyses were performed (correlations, t-tests, ranking tests and tree modeling). The mortality rate was 65/415 (15.7%) and a negative outcome (death and/or orotracheal intubation) affected 98/415 (23.6%) of cases. Univariate tests showed the majority of biomarkers increased in severe patients, but ranking tests helped to select the best variables to put on decisional tree modeling which identified IL-6 as the first dichotomic marker with a cut-off of 114 pg/mL. Then, a good synergy was found between IL-10, MR-proADM, sIL2Rα, IP10 and CRP in increasing the predictive value in classifying patients at risk or not for a negative outcome. In conclusion, beside IL-6, a panel of other cytokines representing the degree of immunoparalysis and the anti-inflammatory response (IP10, sIL2Rα and IL-10) showed synergic role when combined to biomarkers of systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction (CRP, MR-proADM) and may also better explain disease pathogenesis and suggests targeted intervention.},

The present study investigates the association between anti-contagion policies and the spread of COVID-19 across the United States. Design and methods: We selected the most frequently implemented COVID-19 anti-contagion policies in all the U.S. states issued from 29 February 2020. Accordingly, we modified an epidemiological model and combined it with a comprehensive statistical analysis to evaluate the policies’ individual and overall likely impact. Results: For the first time, a novel index, evaluates the associations between policy implementation and COVID-19 spread at both statewide and national levels. Our results indicate that governmental policies requiring mask use, businesses social distancing, and quarantining travelers may be most effective for controlling COVID-19 spread. Simultaneously, widespread orders like school closure and safer-at-home that can be particularly disruptive to the economy and social fabric of society may be unnecessary given their lack of association with reducing infection. Conclusions: The absence of any COVID-19 vaccines during the first several months of its pandemic necessitated using governmental policies to help stop the spread of this disease. Our index showed the association between implemented policies and COVID-19 spread, highlighting the specific policies with the greatest association-mandatory quarantine upon entering a state, businesses implementing social distancing, and mandatory mask use-and those with less association like school closure and saferat-home orders. This study provided evidence to inform policy choices for the current global crisis and future pandemics. Non-commer.},

To assess this threat, we reviewed published evidence of human-to-wildlife transmission events, with a focus on how such events could threaten animal and human health. We identified 97 verified examples, involving a wide range of pathogens; however, reported hosts were mostly non-human primates or large, long-lived captive animals. Relatively few documented examples resulted in morbidity and mortality, and very few led to maintenance of a human pathogen in a new reservoir or subsequent “secondary spillover” back into humans. We discuss limitations in the literature surrounding these phenomena, including strong evidence of sampling bias towards non-human primates and human-proximate mammals and the possibility of systematic bias against reporting human parasites in wildlife, both of which limit our ability to assess the risk of human-to-wildlife pathogen transmission. We outline how researchers can collect experimental and observational evidence that will expand our capacity for risk assessment for human-to-wildlife pathogen transmission.},

The natural history of parathyroid function after successful renal transplantation (RT) and the factors predisposing to persistent hyper-parathyroidism (HPT) are not well established. A better knowledge of these data may be helpful in the development of algorithms for optimal surveillance and treatment of HPT after successful RT. Our aim was to evaluate the post-transplant natural history of parathyroid function and calcium metabolism in patients with a functional renal graft and to identify risk factors for persistent HPT. Methods. Charts of 1165 allograft kidney recipients transplanted between 1989 and 2000 were reviewed. Patients with an intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level available at the time of transplantation were identified. The charts of the latter patients were checked for a variety of demographic and clinical data, and all determinations of the iPTH concentration available since transplantation were recorded. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatases and creatinine, concurrently determined, were also registered. Results. After an initial fall, iPTH levels showed a slow but steady decline towards the upper normal limit. The prevalence of persistent HPT, defined as an iPTH level !2.5 times the upper normal limit or the need for parathyroidectomy following transplantation, remained stable at $17% up to 4 years after transplan-tation. Patients with persistent HPT had significantly elevated serum levels of iPTH, calcium and phosphorus at the time of RT, and had spent a longer time on dialysis. Post-transplant iPTH levels correlated significantly with transplant kidney function. Conclusion. Kidney transplant recipients with a high iPTH and calcium Â phosphate product at the time of transplantation are at risk for persistent HPT especially when renal function is suboptimal. Therapy for persistent HPT, if considered, should be initiated 3 months post-transplantation since further spontaneous improvement of parathyroid function thereafter is limited.},

Automatic Item Generation (AIG) promises to overcome this burden, generating calibrated items based on the work of computer algorithms. Despite the promising scenario, there is still no evidence to encourage a general application of AIG in medical assessment. It is therefore important to evaluate AIG regarding its feasibility, validity and item quality. Objective: Provide a narrative review regarding the feasibility, validity and item quality of AIG in medical assessment. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English language articles published between 2000 and 2021 by means of the terms ‘Automatic Item Generation’, ‘Automated Item Generation’, ‘AIG’, ‘medical assessment’ and ‘medical education’. Reviewers screened 119 records and 13 full texts were checked according to the inclusion criteria. A validity framework was implemented in the included studies to draw conclusions regarding the validity of AIG. Results: A total of 10 articles were included in the review. Synthesized data suggests that AIG is a valid and feasible method capable of generating high-quality items. Conclusions: AIG can solve current problems related to item development. It reveals itself as an auspicious next-generation technique for the future of medical assessment, promising several quality items both quickly and economically.},

Moreover, accessing and preparing another large dataset is not always feasible and time-consuming. Several studies have combined smaller COVID-19 CT datasets into “supersets” to maximize the number of training samples. This study aims to assess generalizability by splitting datasets into different portions based on 3D CT images using deep learning. Method: Two large datasets, including 1110 3D CT images, were split into five segments of 20% each. Each dataset's first 20% segment was separated as a holdout test set. 3D-CNN training was performed with the remaining 80% from each dataset. Two small external datasets were also used to independently evaluate the trained models. Results: The total combination of 80% of each dataset has an accuracy of 91% on Iranmehr and 83% on Moscow holdout test datasets. Results indicated that 80% of the primary datasets are adequate for fully training a model. The additional fine-tuning using 40% of a secondary dataset helps the model generalize to a third, unseen dataset. The highest accuracy achieved through transfer learning was 85% on LDCT dataset and 83% on Iranmehr holdout test sets when retrained on 80% of Iranmehr dataset. Conclusion: While the total combination of both datasets produced the best results, different combinations and transfer learning still produced generalizable results. Adopting the proposed methodology may help to obtain satisfactory results in the case of limited external datasets.},

However, most of tourism practitioners are challenged by a dilemma of focusing on customer or employee acceptance of robots. Borrowing the lenses of resource-based view and information processing theory, this study explores the differential effectiveness of imbalanced robotic strategy (i.e., higher/lower customer acceptance of robots than employee acceptance) implemented by hotels in driving service quality under customer-side (i.e., customer demandingness) and employee-side (i.e., frontline task ambidexterity) demand uncertainties. Polynomial regression analysis on a dataset of 1066 matched customer-employee dyads reveals that, an imbalanced robotic strategy is superior than a balanced one for service quality. In addition, when customer demandingness is high, a customer-focused robotic strategy (i.e., higher customer acceptance of robots than employee acceptance) is the optimal choice to improve service quality. However, when frontline task ambidexterity is high, the positive effects of imbalanced robotic strategy on service quality diminish. This study contributes to the literature on and practices of robot acceptance from a customer-robot-employee triadic perspective.},

   abstract = {An important objective of AI is to understand real-world observations and build up interactive communication with people. The ability to interpret and react to the perception reveals the important necessity of developing such a system across both the modalities of Vision (V) and Language (L). Although there have been massive efforts on various VL tasks, e.g., Image/Video Captioning, Visual Question Answering, and Textual Grounding, very few of them focus on building the VL models with increased efficiency under real-world scenarios. The main focus of this dissertation is to comprehensively investigate the very uncharted efficient VL learning, aiming to build lightweight, data-efficient, and real-world applicable VL models. The proposed studies in this dissertation take three primary aspects into account when it comes to efficient VL, 1). Data Efficiency: collecting task-specific annotations is prohibitively expensive and so manual labor is not always attainable. Techniques are developed to assist the VL learning from implicit supervision, i.e., in a weakly- supervised fashion. 2). Continuing from that, efficient representation learning is further explored with increased scalability, leveraging a large image-text corpus without task-specific annotations. In particular, the knowledge distillation technique is studied for generic Representation Learning which proves to bring substantial performance gain to the regular representation learning schema. 3). Architectural Efficiency. Deploying the VL model on edge devices is notoriously challenging due to their cumbersome architectures. To further extend these advancements to the real world, a novel efficient VL architecture is designed to tackle the inference bottleneck and the inconvenient two-stage training. Extensive discussions have been conducted on several critical aspects that prominently influence the performances of compact VL models.},

According to the United Nations, there is a compelling need to take immediate actions worldwide and to implement large-scale monitoring policies aimed at counteracting the unprecedented levels of air, land, and water pollution. This requires going beyond the legacy technologies currently employed by government authorities and adopting more advanced systems that guarantee a continuous and pervasive monitoring of the environment in all its different aspects. In this paper, we take the research on integrated and largescale environmental monitoring a step further by providing a comprehensive review that covers transversally all the main applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and crowdsensing monitoring technologies. By outlining the available solutions and current limitations, we identify in the cooperation among terrestrial (WSN/crowdsensing) and aerial (UAVs) sensing, coupled with the adoption of advanced signal processing techniques, the major pillars at the basis of future integrated (air, land, and water) and large-scale environmental monitoring systems. This review not only consolidates the progresses achieved in the field of environmental monitoring, but also sheds new lights on potential future research directions and synergies among different research areas.},

A direct consequence of overcrowding is a long wait for visit and treatment of people who require primary care, possibly endangering the lives of critical patients. Healthcare management literature devoted to analyze ED operational policies is very wide, and many approaches have been proposed to address this important problem. However, less attention has been given to patient peak arrivals caused by the occurrence of some critical events which can strongly strain the operational efficiency of an ED. In this paper, we consider the particular case study of a medium-size ED located in a region of Central Italy recently hit by a severe earthquake, aiming at assessing the effects of such an occurrence on the ED operation. In particular, we propose a discrete event simulation (DES) model to analyze the patient flows through this ED, simulating unusual operational conditions due to a critical event, like a natural disaster, which causes a sudden spike in the number of patient arrivals. The availability of detailed data concerning the ED processes enabled building an accurate DES model and performing extensive scenario analyses. The model provides a valid decision support system for the ED managers in assessing specific emergency plans to be activated in case of mass casualty disasters.},

Although hematological parameters in COVID-19-affected individuals from Asian and USA populations are available, there are no descriptions of comparative analyses of CBC findings between COVID-19 positive and negative cases from Latin American countries. In this sense, machine learning techniques have been employed to examine CBC data and aid in screening patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, we used machine learning to compare CBC data between two highly genetically distinguished Latin American countries: Brazil and Ecuador. We notice a clear distribution pattern of positive and negative cases between the two countries. Interestingly, almost all red blood cell count parameters were divergent. For males, neutrophils and lymphocytes are distinct between Brazil and Ecuador, while eosinophils are distinguished for females. Finally, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes displayed a particular distribution for both genders. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the same set of CBC features relevant to one population is unlikely to apply to another. This is the first study to compare CBC data from two genetically distinct Latin American countries.},

The benefits of open data, such as accessibility and transparency, have motivated and enabled a large number of research studies and applications in both academia and industry. However, each open data only offers a single perspective, and its potential inherent limitations (e.g., demographic biases) may lead to poor decisions and misjudgments. This paper discusses how to create and use multiple digital lenses empowered by open data, including census data (macro lens), search logs (meso lens), and social data (micro lens), to investigate general real-world events. To reveal the unique angles and perspectives brought by each open lens, we summarize and compare the underpinning open data from eleven dimensions, such as utility, data volume, dynamic variability, and demographic fairness. Then, we propose an easy-to-use and generalized open data driven framework, which automatically retrieves multi-source data, extracts features, and trains machine learning models for the event specified by answering what, when, and where questions. With low labor efforts, the framework's generalization and automation capabilities guarantee an instant investigation of general events and phenomena, such as disasters, sports events, and political activities. We also conduct two case studies, i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic and Great American Eclipse (see Appendix), to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness at different time granularities.},

The workflow consists in a multi-step approach that goes from identifying the main causes of patient’s outcome through BSL, to the realization of a tool suitable for clinical practice, based on a Binary Decision Tree (BDT), to recognize patients at high-risk with information available already at hospital admission time. We evaluate our approach on a feature-rich dataset of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), showing that the proposed framework provides a schematic overview of the multi-factorial processes that jointly contribute to the outcome. We compare our findings with current literature on COVID-19, showing that this approach allows to re-discover established cause-effect relationships about the disease. Further, our approach yields to a highly interpretable tool correctly predicting the outcome of 85% of subjects based exclusively on 3 features: age, a previous history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at the time of arrival to the hospital. The inclusion of additional information from 4 routine blood tests (Creatinine, Glucose, pO2 and Sodium) increases predictive accuracy to 94.5%.},

With new trends of remote work emerging and predictively prevailing beyond the compulsory confinements, and extended learning delays to recover by children, it is expected that increasingly flexible childcare arrangements are to be demanded by society to fit this new reality – addressing simultaneously long-time concerns from academia and society about the importance of parental involvement and individualized, and child-led, informal learning practices in ECEC.It is proposed the study, co-design and early impact assessment of (1) a nursery- and primary- school-home digital communication platform to facilitate the reveal and setup of relevant informal education activities based on children's own formal education goals and their household's resources – human, spatial and material –, and (2) a serious game, mounted on top of this platform, to motivate and empower young children to be the drivers of their own informal education programs, by leveraging storytelling and role-play over an interface that is accessible and intelligible to them.},

   abstract = {Access-Control Lists (ACLs) (a.k.a. “friend lists”) are one of the most important privacy features of Online Social Networks (OSNs) as they allow users to restrict the audience of their publications. Nevertheless, creating and maintaining custom ACLs can introduce a high cognitive burden on average OSNs users since it normally requires assessing the trustworthiness of a large number of contacts. In principle, community detection algorithms can be leveraged to support the generation of ACLs by mapping a set of examples (i.e. contacts labelled as “untrusted”) to the emerging communities inside the user's ego-network. However, unlike users’ access-control preferences, traditional community-detection algorithms do not take the homophily characteristics of such communities into account (i.e. attributes shared among members). Consequently, this strategy may lead to inaccurate ACL configurations and privacy breaches under certain homophily scenarios. This work investigates the use of community-detection algorithms for the automatic generation of ACLs in OSNs. Particularly, it analyses the performance of the aforementioned approach under different homophily conditions through a simulation model. Furthermore, since private information may reach the scope of untrusted recipients through the re-sharing affordances of OSNs, information diffusion processes are also modelled and taken explicitly into account. Altogether, the removal of gatekeeper nodes is further explored as a strategy to counteract unwanted data dissemination.},

This paper explores the connections between AI and climate change research as a whole and its usefulness in climate change adaptation efforts in particular. Using a systematic review of the literature on applications of AI for climate change adaptation and a questionnaire survey of a multinational and interdisciplinary team of climate change researchers, this paper shows the various means via which AI can support research on climate change in diverse regions, and contribute to efforts towards climate change adaptation. The surveyed articles are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%). In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford policy coherence in climate change. Evidence gathered in the study suggests that, provided that due care is taken, the use of AI can provide a welcome support to global efforts to better understand and handle the many challenges associated with a changing climate.},

   abstract = {When a new environmental policy or a specific intervention is taken in order to improve air quality, it is paramount to assess and quantify—in space and time—the effectiveness of the adopted strategy. The lockdown measures taken worldwide in 2020 to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be envisioned as a policy intervention with an indirect effect on air quality. In this paper we propose a statistical spatiotemporal model as a tool for intervention analysis, able to take into account the effect of weather and other confounding factor, as well as the spatial and temporal correlation existing in the data. In particular, we focus here on the 2019/2020 relative change in nitrogen dioxide (NO (Formula presented.)) concentrations in the north of Italy, for the period of March and April during which the lockdown measure was in force. We found that during March and April 2020 most of the studied area is characterized by negative relative changes (median values around (Formula presented.) 25%), with the exception of the first week of March and the fourth week of April (median values around 5%). As these changes cannot be attributed to a weather effect, it is likely that they are a byproduct of the lockdown measures. There are two aspects of our research that are equally interesting. First, we provide a unique statistical perspective for calculating the relative change in the NO (Formula presented.) by jointly modeling pollutant concentrations time series. Second, as an output we provide a collection of weekly continuous maps, describing the spatial pattern of the NO (Formula presented.) 2019/2020 relative changes.},

Knowledge and technologies that are crucial to Covid-19 messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine development and production were created with the R&D and financial contribution of governments. Patents filed by pharma companies do not protect the public interest arising from such earlier research. The paper offers a case study on the privatization of knowledge created in the first place by R&D in the public sector or supported by public funds and eventually being appropriated by pharmaceutical corporations. The privatization of knowledge is a more general mechanism, relevant in all industries where patents protect corporate R&D which in turn is supported by government direct or indirect subsidies.},

   abstract = {<p>This technical report describes the dynamic causal modelling of mitigated epidemiological outcomes during the COVID-9 coronavirus outbreak in 2020. Dynamic causal modelling is a form of complex system modelling, which uses ‘real world’ timeseries to estimate the parameters of an underlying state space model using variational Bayesian procedures. Its key contribution—in an epidemiological setting—is to embed conventional models within a larger model of sociobehavioural responses—in a way that allows for (relatively assumption-free) forecasting. One advantage of using variational Bayes is that one can progressively optimise the model via Bayesian model selection: generally, the most likely models become more expressive as more data becomes available. This report summarises the model (on 6-Nov-20), eight months after the inception of dynamic causal modelling for COVID-19. This model—and its subsequent updates—is used to provide nowcasts and forecasts of latent behavioural and epidemiological variables as an open science resource. The current report describes the underlying model structure and the rationale for the variational procedures that underwrite Bayesian model selection.</p>},

   abstract = {In this article, we examine how the availability of massive quantities of data, that is, the “Big Data” phenomenon, contributes to the creation, spread, and harms of online misinformation. Specifically, we argue that a factor in the problem of online misinformation is the evolved human instinct to recognize patterns. While the pattern-recognition instinct is a crucial evolutionary adaptation, we argue that in the age of Big Data, these capacities have, unfortunately, rendered us vulnerable. Given the ways in which online media outlets profit from the spread of misinformation by preying on this pattern-finding instinct, we conceptualize the problem that we identify as a morally objectionable form of “epistemic exploitation.” As we argue, the consumer of digital misinformation is often exploited by having her pattern-recognition instinct used against her. This exploitation is morally objectionable because it deprives her of an epistemic good to which she has a right. This epistemic good is the integrity of the pattern-recognition instinct itself, which, we argue, is a capacity that allows us to participate in uniquely human goods. While our primary goal is to bring attention to this form of epistemic exploitation, we conclude by briefly evaluating some general solutions to the growing problem of online misinformation.},

These have been applied to many medical imaging tasks, including disease diagnosis and patient prognosis, as well as augmented other clinical measurements to better inform treatment decisions. Because these systems are used in life-or-death decisions, clinical implementation relies on user trust in the AI output. This has caused many developers to utilize explainability techniques in an attempt to help a user understand when an AI algorithm is likely to succeed as well as which cases may be problematic for automatic assessment, thus increasing the potential for rapid clinical translation. AI application to COVID-19 has been marred with controversy recently. This review discusses several aspects of explainable and interpretable AI as it pertains to the evaluation of COVID-19 disease and it can restore trust in AI application to this disease. This includes the identification of common tasks that are relevant to explainable medical imaging AI, an overview of several modern approaches for producing explainable output as appropriate for a given imaging scenario, a discussion of how to evaluate explainable AI, and recommendations for best practices in explainable/interpretable AI implementation. This review will allow developers of AI systems for COVID-19 to quickly understand the basics of several explainable AI techniques and assist in the selection of an approach that is both appropriate and effective for a given scenario.},

Higher Sustainable Organisational Performance (SOP) means the organization has attained effective and efficient control over the majority of business functions, leading to a sustainable competitive edge over the competitors and higher customer delight. Undoubtedly, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has revolutionized the manufacturing industry and is expected to leverage SOP in times to come. In this context, the study of I4.0 risks reduction and I4.0 drivers needs urgent attention. Similarly, investigating the impact of I4.0 risks reduction and I4.0 adoption on SOP is overlooked in the current literature. Also, the mediating role of I4.0 adoption through I4.0 risks reduction on SOP is yet to be investigated, which has the potential to transform the existing business model into a progressive, viable, and sustainable model. This research has established a theoretical model grounded on Contingency and Dynamic Capability View (DCV) theory. The model has explored the scope of I4.0 adoption to SOP by considering I4.0 drivers impacting I4.0 adoption and I4.0 risks mitigations impacting I4.0 risks reduction and their influence on SOP. Total 15 hypotheses are tested using software packages SmartPLS 3.0 and SPSS v23.0 based on the 273 respondents' data from 221 manufacturing companies of India. The research found I4.0 adoption and I4.0 risks reduction positively drive SOP, and I4.0 adoption has a positive significant mediating effect on the relationship between I4.0 risks reduction and SOP. This study has the potential to support managers, decision-makers, and researchers to build, test, and validate similar models adding minor reforms and developing innovative and creative combinations of inherent capabilities and resources to realize the SOP in manufacturing companies. The study is unique as it has explored the link between I4.0 risks reduction, I4.0 adoption, SOP, I4.0 drivers, and I4.0 risks mitigations for the first time. In addition, the investigation on the mediating effect of I4.0 adoption in the relationship between I4.0 risks reduction and SOP is a pioneering contribution to the existing literature.},

Here, we used an existing disturbance framework to propose new investigation pathways for coordinated studies of distributed, long-term social-ecological research to capture effects of the anthropause.

These early findings may guide interpretations of effects of the anthropause as it interacts with other ongoing environmental changes in the future, particularly highlighting the importance of long-term data in separating disturbance impacts from natural variation and long-term trends.

An important goal for the CS education community is to understand these younger learners' experiences during remote programming activities. This experience report describes a three-day learning experience in which 18 middle school students engaged in remote pair programming activities by modeling scientific processes in a block-based programming language. After three remote pair programming sessions, we conducted individual interviews to understand middle school students' experiences during remote pair programming activities as well as comparing these new experiences to their previous co-located pair programming experiences. The results from these interviews suggest that the majority of the students (72%) enjoyed the remote activities despite many (55%) experiencing some form of technical difficulty. The interviews revealed important opportunities and challenges that being remote brought to pair programming within themes of changes in communication and focus, pair programming dynamics, and available resources. Students also identified issues with remote collaboration such as technical difficulties from software that impaired their ability to work and to communicate. These observations inform new efforts to adapt CS education to the increased demand for remote collaborative work and reveal patterns that may increase success in this new work style.},

The fingerprint identification technology of communication equipment is mainly based on the fingerprint characteristics represented on the transmitted signals of the equipment, which are different from other devices, and the connection between the characteristics and the hardware equipment is established, so as to realize the purpose of identifying the communication equipment. In this paper, the author studies the key technologies related to fingerprint recognition of communication equipment, including signal acquisition, signal feature extraction, and classifier design, and transient signal recognition equipment. In this paper, the integrated learning and deep learning based on fingerprint recognition are taken as the main research contents of communication equipment, and the fingerprint recognition scheme of communication equipment is given; the proposed scheme is verified by the measured data. Aiming at the transient signal of communication equipment, an algorithm using the short-term periodicity of signal is presented. The feature extraction of steady-state signal is realized. The autoencoder feature and four kinds of integral bispectrum feature are analyzed and visualized. Research on communication equipment individual recognition technology is based on ensemble learning. An individual recognition scheme for communication devices based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classification model is studied. The Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model with different parameters was used as the primary learner of stacking classifier. The steady-state signal recognition of mobile phones based on deep learning is studied. The results show that the stacking recognition rate improved by about 2% compared with GBDT using multiple GBDT models with different parameters as the primary learner.},

   abstract = {The recent COVID-19 outbreak impact on the world economy has boosted the increasing business needs to force manufacturing plants adapting to unpredictable changes and ensuring the continuity of industrial production. The demand for asset monitoring solutions and specialised support at the shop floor has become an increasingly important digital priority in industry that pushes human–machine technological upgrades leading to digital workforce skills assessment. In the case of traditional manufacturing, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face the challenge of managing digital technologies and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) maturity models with a low adoption rate. In this digital context very few SMEs with traditional means have anticipated the latest advances in maintenance strategies impeded by technical and economical barriers. This work presents a human–machine technological integration solution in traditional manufacturing based on a non-intrusive retrofitting development with interoperable I4.0 tools. The method provides a common and rapidly deployable hardware and software architecture supporting an HMI-based legacy maintenance approach and addresses its evaluation focused on the physical-digital convergence of older industrial systems. A case study applying a digital process approach integrated with condition-based maintenance (CBM) techniques, has been carried out on a CNC milling machine and reproduced in an injection moulding machine during COVID-19 alert state. These already existing scenarios served to deploy digital retrofitting and communication strategies without interfering in working conditions. Patterns extracted from the machines were monitored in real-time interacting with the operational knowledge of the experienced staff. In this way, we provided an original contribution to confront human–machine challenges with improvements applied in traditional manufacturing, where workers and industrial systems were collaboratively updated with augmented digital strategies and proactive CBM environments.},

In the absence of an accepted systems theory to interrogate synergistic responses, we introduce Omics-Based Interaction Framework (OBIF) to reveal molecular drivers of synergy through integration of statistical and biological interactions in synergistic biological responses. OBIF performs full factorial analysis of feature expression data from single versus dual exposures to identify molecular clusters that reveal synergy-mediating pathways, functions and regulators. As a practical demonstration, OBIF analyzed transcriptomic and proteomic data of a dyad of immunostimulatory molecules that induces synergistic protection against influenza A and revealed unanticipated NF-κB/AP-1 cooperation that is required for antiviral protection. To demonstrate generalizability, OBIF analyzed data from a diverse array of Omics platforms and experimental conditions, successfully identifying the molecular clusters driving their synergistic responses. Hence, unlike existing synergy quantification and prediction methods, OBIF is a phenotype-driven systems model that supports multiplatform interrogation of synergy mechanisms.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for earthquake-induced damage identification of historical constructions through sparse multivariate regression. The proposed methodology comprises a first data cleansing stage using the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) method to mitigate the adverse effects related to the existence of outliers in the training feature dataset. Afterwards, a sparse multiple linear regression model (SMLR) is trained using the least-angle regression (LAR) model to eliminate the influence of environmental effects upon the selected features set. The proposed SMLR model allows to identify the optimal set of predictors in a fully automated way, minimizing the need for expert judgement in the process. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with an application case study of a monumental masonry palace, the Consoli Palace in Gubbio (Italy). The palace has been monitored with an aggregated static/dynamic/environmental SHM system since July 14th 2020. A recent seismic sequence of small intensity hit the palace on May 15th 2021 with a main earthquake of magnitude Mw 4.0. The epicentres of the main seismic event and the following aftershocks were located at a distance of 2–3 km far from the palace, making this case study a prominent example of a monumental construction subjected to near-field ground motion. The presented results demonstrate that a new damage condition arises in the Consoli Palace after the seismic sequence, although its severity remains at an early stage not detectable by visual inspections.},

In this paper, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based information processing algorithm has been used to provide a solution to this problem and it has been found suitable to predict machines availability as a prediction function. The considered pharmaceutical plants are dealing with production of medicines related common symptoms in case of COVID-19 (fever, coughing, and breathing problems). The pharmaceutical plant data corresponding to different values of repair and failure rates of different subsystems is collected from plant and analyzed with the help of validated neural network value of availability. This configuration of ANNs approach developed in this research allowed simplifying computational complexities of conventional approaches to solve a large plant machines availability problem. The ANNs methodology in the paper permitted making no assumption, no explicit coding of the problem, no complete knowledge of system configuration, only raw input and clean data found to be sufficient to determine the value of machine availability function for different value of failure and repair rates considered in the paper. The results obtained in the paper are useful for the plant leadership, as the value of failure and repair rates of various subsystems can be fine-tuned at a require clear-cut level to achieve higher availability, and avoid considerably loss of production, loss of man power, and by-pass complete breakdown of concerned system.},

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic caused by a newly discovered virus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organisation in 2019. RT-PCR is considered the golden standard for COVID-19 detection. Due to the limited RT-PCR resources, early diagnosis of the disease has become a challenge. Radiographic images such as Ultrasound, CT scans, X-rays can be used for the detection of the deathly disease. Developing deep learning models using radiographic images for detecting COVID-19 can assist in countering the outbreak of the virus. This paper presents a computer-aided detection model utilizing chest X-ray images for combating the pandemic. Several pre-trained networks and their combinations have been used for developing the model. The method uses features extracted from pre-trained networks along with Sparse autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) for the detection of COVID-19. Two publicly available chest X-ray image datasets, consisting of 504 COVID-19 images and 542 non-COVID-19 images, have been combined to train the model. The method was able to achieve an accuracy of 0.9578 and an AUC of 0.9821, using the combination of InceptionResnetV2 and Xception. Experiments have proved that the accuracy of the model improves with the usage of sparse autoencoder as the dimensionality reduction technique.},

   abstract = {Background: Delays in admitting high-risk emergency surgery patients to the intensive care unit result in worse outcomes and increased health care costs. We aimed to use interpretable artificial intelligence technology to create a preoperative predictor for postoperative intensive care unit need in emergency surgery patients. Methods: A novel, interpretable artificial intelligence technology called optimal classification trees was leveraged in an 80:20 train:test split of adult emergency surgery patients in the 2007–2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory values were used to develop, train, and then validate optimal classification tree algorithms to predict the need for postoperative intensive care unit admission. The latter was defined as postoperative death or the development of 1 or more postoperative complications warranting critical care (eg, unplanned intubation, ventilator requirement ≥48 hours, cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and septic shock). An interactive and user-friendly application was created. C statistics were used to measure performance. Results: A total of 464,861 patients were included. The mean age was 55 years, 48% were male, and 11% developed severe postoperative complications warranting critical care. The Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk Intensive Care Unit application was created as the user-friendly interface of the complex optimal classification tree algorithms. The number of questions (ie, tree depths) needed to predict intensive care unit admission ranged from 2 to 11. The Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk Intensive Care Unit application had excellent discrimination for predicting the need for intensive care unit admission (C statistics: 0.89 train, 0.88 test). Conclusion: We recommend the Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk Intensive Care Unit application as an accurate, artificial intelligence–based tool for predicting severe complications warranting intensive care unit admission after emergency surgery. The Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk Intensive Care Unit application can prove useful to triage patients to the intensive care unit and to potentially decrease failure to rescue in emergency surgery patients.},

With this transformation, many benefits are expected, such as the automation and decentralization of production processes. Nevertheless, enterprises face considerable risks upon successful implementation of Industry 4.0. The uncertainties regarding these risks are currently hindering enterprises’ implementation of Industry 4.0. Although several studies have investigated the adoption of Industry 4.0-related technologies, far too little attention has been devoted to identifying and analyzing the risk factors associated with the adoption of these technologies in manufacturing, especially in Irish industry. Therefore, this study contributes to the existing knowledge by proposing a systematic approach to identifying and ranking these risk factors along with recommending policies to mitigate the highest risks. Fourteen risk factors are identified, and the opinions of 12 industry experts across the Irish manufacturing sector are used to rank these risk factors using an adjusted best-worst method. The lack of standards and lack of methodological approaches was the highest-ranking risk factor, with the risk to capital investment, the lack of talent, the uncertainty in economic benefits and the potential delay to the manufacturing process ranking in the top 5. Policy recommendations to mitigate the highest-ranking risks are proposed based on an analysis of the Irish government's current Industry 4.0 policy. Governments should aim to assist industries in establishing comprehensive standards to increase the rate of successful Industry 4.0 implementation.},

Besides, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network is benchmarked to supported vector machine and multiple linear regression. Although all the considered models have the ability to provide accurate prediction results, the findings indicate that the proposed supported vector machine and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network model provide better prediction results. The analysis was achieved through a methodology to identify factors with the highest impact and build a neural network model. The model was further optimized to identify the best order and select the best subset of input variables. The analysis showed that the neural network model can be used effectively to estimate the delivery time of oxygen gas cylinders.

During the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019 and the worldwide epidemic, the importance of this issue becomes more apparent. Due to the importance of the issue, a large number of researchers have begun to collect English datasets and to study COVID-19 fake news detection. However, there are a large number of low-resource languages, including Persian, that cannot develop accurate tools for automatic COVID-19 fake news detection due to the lack of annotated data for the task. In this article, we aim to develop a corpus for Persian in the domain of COVID-19 where the fake news is annotated and to provide a model for detecting Persian COVID-19 fake news. With the impressive advancement of multilingual pre-trained language models, the idea of cross-lingual transfer learning can be proposed to improve the generalization of models trained with low-resource language datasets. Accordingly, we use the state-of-the-art deep cross-lingual contextualized language model, XLM-RoBERTa, and the parallel convolutional neural networks to detect Persian COVID-19 fake news. Moreover, we use the idea of knowledge transferring across-domains to improve the results by using both the English COVID-19 dataset and the general domain Persian fake news dataset. The combination of both cross-lingual and cross-domain transfer learning has outperformed the models and it has beaten the baseline by 2.39% significantly.},

   abstract = {This study proposes a new hybrid deep learning (DL) model, the called CSVR, for Global Solar Radiation (GSR) predictions by integrating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Support Vector Regression (SVR) approach. First, the CNN algorithm is used to extract local patterns as well as common features that occur recurrently in time series data at different intervals. Then, the SVR is subsequently adopted to replace the fully connected CNN layers to predict the daily GSR time series data at six solar farms in Queensland, Australia. To develop the hybrid CSVR model, we adopt the most pertinent meteorological variables from Global Climate Model and Scientific Information for Landowners database. From a pool of Global Climate Models variables and ground-based observations, the optimal features are selected through a metaheuristic Feature Selection algorithm, an Atom Search Optimization method. The hyperparameters of the proposed CSVR are optimized by mean of the HyperOpt method, and the overall performance of the objective algorithm is benchmarked against eight alternative DL methods, and some of the other Machine Learning approaches (LSTM, DBN, RBF, BRF, MARS, WKNNR, GPML and M5TREE) methods. The results obtained shows that the proposed CSVR model can offer several predictive advantages over the alternative DL models, as well as the conventional ML models. Specifically, we note that the CSVR model recorded a root mean square error/mean absolute error ranging between ≈ 2.172–3.305 MJ m2/1.624–2.370 MJ m2 over the six tested solar farms compared to ≈ 2.514–3.879 MJ m2/1.939–2.866 MJ m2 from alternative ML and DL algorithms. Consistent with this predicted error, the correlation between the measured and the predicted GSR, including the Willmott's, Nash-Sutcliffe's coefficient and Legates & McCabe's Index was relatively higher for the proposed CSVR model compared to other DL and Machine Learning methods for all of the study sites. Accordingly, this study advocates the merits of CSVR model to provide a viable alternative to accurately predict GSR for renewable energy exploitation, energy demand or other forecasting-based applications.},

Existing monitoring systems continuously track the performance of deployed ML models and compute feature importance (a.k.a. explanations) for each prediction to help developers identify the root causes of emergent model performance problems.We present Quantile Demographic Drift (QDD), a novel model bias quantification metric that uses quantile binning to measure differences in the overall prediction distributions over subgroups. QDD is ideal for continuous monitoring scenarios, does not suffer from the statistical limitations of conventional threshold-based bias metrics, and does not require outcome labels (which may not be available at runtime). We incorporate QDD into a continuous model monitoring system, called FairCanary, that reuses existing explanations computed for each individual prediction to quickly compute explanations for the QDD bias metrics.

In this scenario, people must be careful and cautious about the symptoms and should act accordingly. Accurate predictions of different factors, like the end date of the pandemic, duration of lockdown and spreading trend can guide us through the pandemic and precautions can be taken accordingly. Multiple attempts have been made to model the virus transmission, but none of them has investigated it at a global level. The novelty of the proposed work lies here. In this paper, first, authors have analysed spreading of the said disease using data collected from various platforms and then, have presented a predictive mathematical model for fifteen countries from first, second and third world for probable future projections of this pandemic. The prediction can be used by planning commission, healthcare organizations and the government agencies as well for creating suitable arrangements against this pandemic.},

   abstract = {This paper introduces an architecture – B2H – to enable a delay-tolerant public blockchain network (PBCN) in healthcare systems for Society 5.0. Healthcare systems in Society 5.0 envision an abstract paradigm that provides beyond health monitoring services to all the citizens of the society. These services include healthcare medical supply chain, clinical trial, and hospital management. To provide these services, the existing healthcare systems upload their important information, such as users’ health parameters, medicinal details, and clinical trial information into the cloud using PBCN (Ioppolo et al., 2020). Additionally, PBCN provides end-to-end security in uploading of such healthcare information in healthcare systems by decentralizing and distributing the information validation among multiple end-user devices. The existing PBCN-based healthcare systems enable its users to validate information before the transaction of healthcare information. Enabling such a facility in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0 increases the validation latency of PBCN in healthcare systems, considering the presence of a huge number of citizens in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the existing PBCN-based healthcare systems are unable to detect malicious end-users, which may degrade the efficiency of the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. We introduce B2H to address the issues of increasing validation latency and detecting malicious end-users in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. The architecture of B2H utilizes the features of PBCN. B2H introduce a layer of validation service providers (VSPs) in a PBCN that collects information from the end-user, distributes it among multiple validation devices. VSP in B2H reduces the validation time by distributing the information among a specific set of validation devices (VDs). B2H also allows the end-user to optimally select a VSP and a VSP to select a set of validation devices optimally. Through extensive experiments, we observe that B2H performs better than the existing schemes by reducing 94%–95% average network delay, 88%–94% average energy consumption, and 94%–96% average cost.},

Great efforts were spent to fight the emergency, with the widespread use of cutting-edge technologies, especially big data analytics and AI. In this context, the present study proposes a novel combination of geographical filtering and machine learning (ML) for the development and optimization of a COVID-19 early alert system based on Emergency Medical Services (EMS) data, for the anticipated identification of outbreaks with very high granularity, up to single municipalities. The model, implemented for the region of Lombardy, Italy, showed robust performance, with an overall 80% accuracy in identifying the active spread of the disease. The further post-processing of the output was implemented to classify the territory into five risk classes, resulting in effectively anticipating the demand for interventions by EMS. This model shows state-of-art potentiality for future applications in the early detection of the burden of the impact of COVID-19, or other similar epidemics, on the healthcare system.</p>},

Earlier in the pandemic, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on X-Ray data. Here, addressing the lacunae in existing literature and algorithms with the paucity of initial training data; we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool using an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for COVID-Pneumonia diagnosis, trained entirely on pre-COVID-19 datasets. The performance and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. Firstly, 1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine center to assess effectiveness in excluding radiological COVID-Pneumonia requiring higher care. Second, curated dataset; 434 RT-PCR positive cases and 471 non-COVID/Normal historical scans, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had an accuracy of 87% with a negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data. However, sensitivity was 0.66–0.90 taking RT-PCR/radiologist opinion as ground truth. This work provides new insights on the usage of EDS with DL methods and the ability of algorithms to confidently predict COVID-Pneumonia while reinforcing the established learning; that benchmarking based on RT-PCR may not serve as reliable ground truth in radiological diagnosis. Such tools can pave the path for multi-modal high throughput detection of COVID-Pneumonia in screening and referral.},

   abstract = {<p>An immune correlate of risk (CoR) is an immunologic biomarker in vaccine recipients associated with an infectious disease clinical endpoint. An immune correlate of protection (CoP) is a CoR that can be used to reliably predict vaccine efficacy (VE) against the clinical endpoint and hence is accepted as a surrogate endpoint that can be used for accelerated approval or guide use of vaccines. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, CoR analysis is limited by not assessing a causal vaccine effect. To address this limitation, we construct the controlled risk curve of a biomarker, which provides the causal risk of an endpoint if all participants are assigned vaccine and the biomarker is set to different levels. Furthermore, we propose a causal CoP analysis based on controlled effects, where for the important special case that the biomarker is constant in the placebo arm, we study the controlled vaccine efficacy curve that contrasts the controlled risk curve with placebo arm risk. We provide identification conditions and formulae that account for right censoring of the clinical endpoint and two-phase sampling of the biomarker, and consider G-computation estimation and inference under a semiparametric model such as the Cox model. We add modular approaches to sensitivity analysis that quantify robustness of CoP evidence to unmeasured confounding. We provide an application to two phase 3 trials of a dengue vaccine indicating that controlled risk of dengue strongly varies with 50$\%$ neutralizing antibody titer. Our work introduces controlled effects causal mediation analysis to immune CoP evaluation.</p>},

   abstract = {Objectives: To conduct a systematic survey of published techniques for automated diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 diseases using medical imaging, assessing the validity of reported performance and investigating the proposed clinical use-case. To conduct a scoping review into the authors publishing such work. Methods: The Scopus database was queried and studies were screened for article type, and minimum source normalized impact per paper and citations, before manual relevance assessment and a bias assessment derived from a subset of the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM). The number of failures of the full CLAIM was adopted as a surrogate for risk-of-bias. Methodological and performance measurements were collected from each technique. Each study was assessed by one author. Comparisons were evaluated for significance with a two-sided independent t-test. Findings: Of 1002 studies identified, 390 remained after screening and 81 after relevance and bias exclusion. The ratio of exclusion for bias was 71%, indicative of a high level of bias in the field. The mean number of CLAIM failures per study was 8.3 ± 3.9 [1,17] (mean ± standard deviation [min,max]). 58% of methods performed diagnosis versus 31% prognosis. Of the diagnostic methods, 38% differentiated COVID-19 from healthy controls. For diagnostic techniques, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.924 ± 0.074 [0.810,0.991] and accuracy = 91.7% ± 6.4 [79.0,99.0]. For prognostic techniques, AUC = 0.836 ± 0.126 [0.605,0.980] and accuracy = 78.4% ± 9.4 [62.5,98.0]. CLAIM failures did not correlate with performance, providing confidence that the highest results were not driven by biased papers. Deep learning techniques reported higher AUC (p < 0.05) and accuracy (p < 0.05), but no difference in CLAIM failures was identified. Interpretation: A majority of papers focus on the less clinically impactful diagnosis task, contrasted with prognosis, with a significant portion performing a clinically unnecessary task of differentiating COVID-19 from healthy. Authors should consider the clinical scenario in which their work would be deployed when developing techniques. Nevertheless, studies report superb performance in a potentially impactful application. Future work is warranted in translating techniques into clinical tools.},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 has caused immeasurable damage worldwide and available treatments with high efficacy are still scarce. With the continuous emergence of new variants of the virus, such as Omicron, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta - the so-called variants of concern, the available therapeutic and prevention strategies had to return to the experimental trial to verify their effectiveness against them. This work aims to expand the knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) interactions with cell receptors and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Special attention is given to the Omicron variant and its comparison with the others, including its sublineage BA.2 and two new ones (B.1.640.1 and B.1.640.2/IHU) recently found in France. By using constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations, the free energy of interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) from different variants and several partners (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) polymorphisms and several mAbs) were calculated. It was evaluated both the impact of mutations for the RBD-ACE2 and how strongly each of mAb can bind to the virus RBD, which can indicate their therapeutic potential for neutralization. RBD-ACE2-binding affinities were higher for two ACE2 polymorphisms typically found in Europeans (rs142984500 and rs4646116), indicating that these types of polymorphisms may be related to genetic susceptibility to COVID-19. The antibody landscape was computationally investigated with the largest set of mAbs so far in the literature. From the 33 studied binders, groups of mAbs were identified with weak (e.g. S110 and Ab3b4), medium (e.g. CR3022), and strong binding affinities (e.g. P01, S2K146 and S230). All the mAbs with strong binding capacity could also bind to the RBD from SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 wt, and all studied variants. These mAbs and especially their combination are amenable to experimentation and clinical trials because of their high binding affinities and neutralization potential for current known virus mutations and a universal coronavirus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The current research investigates how the magnitude of price dispersion in online pricing can influence travelers’ product evaluations and purchase intentions. Specifically, we predict that travelers will prefer a hotel with no price dispersion to a hotel with different prices listed when the price difference is small, or narrow. However, when the price difference is more pronounced, or wide, travelers will prefer a hotel with price differences compared to a hotel with no price dispersion. Four experiments demonstrate that this effect is consistent across different contexts and categories. Additionally, based on life history theory, we argue that the relative preference for the same versus different price dispersion will be moderated by the travelers’ childhood socioeconomic status (SES).},

This essay selectively reviews the copious literature that now exists on the long-term impact of natural disasters. At this point, the long-run resilience of cities to many forms of physical destruction, including bombing, earthquakes and fires, has been well-documented. The destruction of human capital may leave a longer imprint, but cities have persisted through many plagues over the past millennia. By contrast, economic and political shocks, including deindustrialisation or the loss of capital city status, can enormously harm an urban area. These facts suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic will only significantly alter urban fortunes if it is accompanied by a major economic shift, such as widespread adoption of remote work, or political shifts that could lead businesses and the wealthy to leave urban areas. The combination of an increased ability to relocate with increased local redistribution or deterioration of local amenity levels, or both, could recreate some of the key attributes of the urban crisis of the 1970s.},

Research can provide important evidence on the potential consequences of different actions with regard to specific objectives. However, research conclusions also remain uncertain and typically depend on many assumptions. I argue that since policy prescriptions entail claims about future consequences, they must be seen as predictions. Although prediction is difficult, especially about the future, we can have better and more informed discussions about policy consequences if we pay attention to what we have learned about predictions and predicting better. Moreover, beyond whether predictions are ultimately correct or not, it is useful to consider what we can learn from them. In some cases, it is more helpful to understand how specific inputs influence predictions than to focus only on approaches that maximize overall fit. Predictions may not be intended to influence policy, but research is more likely to be useful to non-academics if presented in a clear and accessible manner. Finally, since the outcomes we try to predict depend on policy choices, we can potentially improve predictions by thinking about how decisions are made.</p>},

When assessing the similarity between data points, one can build various distance measures using subsets of these features. Finding a small set of features that still retains sufficient information about the dataset is important for the successful application of many statistical learning approaches. We introduce a statistical test that can assess the relative information retained when using 2 different distance measures, and determine if they are equivalent, independent, or if one is more informative than the other. This ranking can in turn be used to identify the most informative distance measure and, therefore, the most informative set of features, out of a pool of candidates. To illustrate the general applicability of our approach, we show that it reproduces the known importance ranking of policy variables for Covid-19 control, and also identifies compact yet informative descriptors for atomic structures. We further provide initial evidence that the information asymmetry measured by the proposed test can be used to infer relationships of causality between the features of a dataset. The method is general and should be applicable to many branches of science.},

Although SCO is predicated on alignment across supply chain members, it has primarily been examined at the individual firm level. Given this limitation, we collected triadic archival and survey data from multiple levels of the supply chain to introduce the concepts of SCO supplier fit (i.e., firm's SCO matches its supplier) and SCO customer fit (i.e., firm's SCO matches its customer). The results reveal that SCO supplier fit and SCO customer fit each positively impacts firm operational and customer performance in return on assets (ROA) and return on sales (ROS). More specifically, a firm with an SCO matching its primary upstream or downstream partners performs significantly better than a firm with a higher or lower SCO. In fact, firms with relatively more SCO than key supply chain partners perform significantly worse than those having relatively less SCO. Finally, firms with both SCO supplier fit and SCO customer fit perform better than firms with SCO supplier or customer fit alone. Ultimately, SCO alignment across the supply chain appears to be more important than the level of SCO itself.},

Motivated by their performance, multiple studies have focused on designing deep convolutional neural network architectures tailored to detect COVID-19 cases from chest computerized tomography (CT) images. However, a fundamental challenge of DNN models is their inability to explain the reasoning for a diagnosis. Explainability is essential for medical diagnosis, where understanding the reason for a decision is as important as the decision itself. A variety of algorithms have been proposed that generate explanations and strive to enhance users' trust in DNN models. Yet, the influence of the generated machine learning explanations on clinicians' trust for complex decision tasks in healthcare has not been understood. This study evaluates the quality of explanations generated for a deep learning model that detects COVID-19 based on CT images and examines the influence of the quality of these explanations on clinicians’ trust. First, we collect radiologist-annotated explanations of the CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 to create the ground truth. We then compare ground truth explanations with machine learning explanations. Our evaluation shows that the explanations produced. by different algorithms were often correct (high precision) when compared to the radiologist annotated ground truth but a significant number of explanations were missed (significantly lower recall). We further conduct a controlled experiment to study the influence of machine learning explanations on clinicians' trust for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Our findings show that while the clinicians’ trust in automated diagnosis increases with the explanations, their reliance on the diagnosis reduces as clinicians are less likely to rely on algorithms that are not close to human judgement. Clinicians want higher recall of the explanations for a better understanding of an automated diagnosis system.},

In response, this article advances a cognitive-cultural framework, wherein behavior reflects preferences derived from schema usage. Using cross-national wargames, the article illustrates the schematic use of strategic culture as a basis for deriving strategic objectives and the means of achieving these. Consequently, the article is an initial foray aimed at expanding our understanding of interstate behavior in cyberspace.},

Here we report a-proof-of-concept study on hyperspectral image analysis in the visible and near-infrared range for primary screening at the point-of-care of SARS-CoV-2. We apply spectral feature descriptors, partial least square-discriminant analysis, and artificial intelligence to extract information from optical diffuse reflectance measurements from 5 µL fluid samples at pixel, droplet, and patient levels. We discern preparations of engineered lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 from those with the G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus in saline solution and artificial saliva. We report a quantitative analysis of 72 samples of nasopharyngeal exudate in a range of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, and a descriptive study of another 32 fresh human saliva samples. Sensitivity for classification of exudates was 100% with peak specificity of 87.5% for discernment from PCR-negative but symptomatic cases. Proposed technology is reagent-free, fast, and scalable, and could substantially reduce the number of molecular tests currently required for COVID-19 mass screening strategies even in resource-limited settings.},

   abstract = {In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments declared severe restrictions throughout 2020, presenting an unprecedented scenario of reduced anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants derived mainly from traffic sources. To analyze the effect of these restrictions derived from COVID-19 pandemic on air quality levels, relative changes in NO, NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were calculated at urban traffic sites in the most populated Spanish cities over different periods with distinct restrictions in 2020. In addition to the changes calculated with respect to the observed air pollutant levels of previous years (2013–2019), relative changes were also calculated using predicted pollutant levels for the different periods over 2020 on a business-as-usual scenario using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models with meteorological and seasonal predictors. MLR models were selected among different data mining techniques (MLR, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)), based on their higher performance and accuracy obtained from a leave-one-year-out cross-validation scheme using 2013–2019 data. A q-q mapping post-correction was also applied in all cases in order to improve the reliability of the predictions to reproduce the observed distributions and extreme events. This approach allows us to estimate the relative changes in the studied air pollutants only due to COVID-19 restrictions. The results obtained from this approach show a decreasing pattern for NOx, with the largest reduction in the lockdown period above −50%, whereas the increase observed for O3 contrasts with the NOx patterns with a maximum increase of 23.9%. The slight reduction in PM10 (−4.1%) and PM2.5 levels (−2.3%) during lockdown indicates a lower relationship with traffic sources. The developed methodology represents a simple but robust framework for exploratory analysis and intervention detection in air quality studies.},

   abstract = {As global value chains (GVCs) account for 80% of global trade, the revival of protectionism, amidst the looming trade tensions between United States and other trading partners, particularly China will dampen the international input–output relations. By using a multi-regional and multi-sectoral dynamic computable general equilibrium model, this study analyses China driven GVCs. The study explores the impact of tariff change on China and its major trading partners on economic variables like consumption, investment, government expenditure, exports and imports and sectors like electronic goods, coal, crude oil and machine equipment for the five-year period, that is, 2021–2025. GTAP 10 database has been used. The findings of the study suggest that although China’s dominance may diminish, yet it would continue to be one of the prominent players in GVC. Further, based on the results, the global economy can look forward to fragmented and locally oriented supply chains. At the sectoral level, the shorter supply chains would lead a further disjoint global trade system with a wider range of suppliers for similar products and hence increased regionalisation of production.

Historically, there has been a lack of technical requirements for DG to provide system support and for network operators to monitor, control and gather detailed information on DG installations. As a result, much of it is unobservable and uncontrollable. This work has analysed the available data sources for the amount, size and type of DG installations in GB. It is found that the lack of transparency and consistency of data are likely to act as an obstacle to the development of a more active distribution network. The impact that high DG has on system operation and system stability is discussed, including the potential for DG to offer flexibility services. A system disturbance in GB on August 9th 2019 brought a number of issues into focus: Slow action to change inappropriate settings of DG loss-of-mains protection and the uncertainty that DG adds to the effectiveness of under frequency load shedding schemes. Finally, it is argued that coordination between transmission and distribution networks is central to addressing many of the challenges and is a key enabler to utilising the flexibility available from DERs and releasing capacity for more DERs to be connected.},

   abstract = {Governments and healthcare organizations increasingly pay attention to social media for handling a disease outbreak. The institutions and organizations need information support to gain insights into the situation and act accordingly. Currently, they primarily rely on ground-level data, collecting which is a long and cumbersome process. Social media data present immense opportunities to use ground data quickly and effectively. Governments and HOs can use these data in launching rapid and speedy remedial actions. Social media data contain rich content in the form of people's reactions, calls-for-help, and feedback. However, in healthcare operations, the research on social media for providing information support is limited. Our study attempts to fill the gap mentioned above by investigating the relationship between the activity on social media and the quantum of the outbreak and further using content analytics to construct a model for segregating tweets. We use the case example of the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic has advantages in contributing to the generalizability of results and facilitating the model's validation through data from multiple waves. The findings show that social media activity reflects the outbreak situation on the ground. In particular, we find that negative tweets posted by people during a crisis outbreak concur with the quantum of a disease outbreak. Further, we find a positive association between this relationship and increased information sharing through retweets. Building further on this insight, we propose a model using advanced analytical methods to reduce a large amount of unstructured data into four key categories—irrelevant posts, emotional outbursts, distress alarm, and relief measures. The supply-side stakeholders (such as policy makers and humanitarian organizations) could use this information on time and optimize resources and relief packages in the right direction proactively.},

   abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has shown great success in the field of medical image analysis. In the wake of the current pandemic situation of SARS-CoV-2, a few pioneering works based on DL have made significant progress in automated screening of COVID-19 disease from the chest X-ray (CXR) images. But these DL models have no inherent way of expressing uncertainty associated with the model's prediction, which is very important in medical image analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an uncertainty-aware convolutional neural network model, named UA-ConvNet, for the automated detection of COVID-19 disease from CXR images, with an estimation of associated uncertainty in the model's predictions. The proposed approach utilizes the EfficientNet-B3 model and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, where an EfficientNet-B3 model has been fine-tuned on the CXR images. During inference, MC dropout has been applied for M forward passes to obtain the posterior predictive distribution. After that mean and entropy have been calculated on the obtained predictive distribution to get the mean prediction and model uncertainty. The proposed method is evaluated on the three different datasets of chest X-ray images, namely the COVID19CXr, X-ray image, and Kaggle datasets. The proposed UA-ConvNet model achieves a G-mean of 98.02% (with a Confidence Interval (CI) of 97.99–98.07) and sensitivity of 98.15% for the multi-class classification task on the COVID19CXr dataset. For binary classification, the proposed model achieves a G-mean of 99.16% (with a CI of 98.81–99.19) and a sensitivity of 99.30% on the X-ray Image dataset. Our proposed approach shows its superiority over the existing methods for diagnosing the COVID-19 cases from the CXR images.},

   abstract = {Quantitative sociologists and social policymakers are increasingly interested in local context. Some city-specific studies have developed new primary data collection efforts to analyze inequality at the neighborhood level, but methods from spatial microsimulation have yet to be broadly used in sociology to take better advantage of existing public data sets. The American Community Survey (ACS) is the largest household survey in the United States and indispensable for detailed analysis of specific places and populations. The authors propose a technique, tree-based spatial microsimulation, to produce “small-area” (census-tract) estimates of any person- or household-level phenomenon that can be derived from ACS microdata variables. The approach is straightforward and computationally efficient, based only on publicly available data, and it provides more reliable estimates than do prevailing methods of microsimulation. The authors demonstrate the technique’s capabilities by producing tract-level estimates, stratified by race/ethnicity, of (1) the proportion of people in the census-tract population who have children and work in an essential occupation and (2) the proportion of people in the census-tract population living below the federal poverty threshold and in a household that spends greater than 50 percent of monthly income on rent or owner costs. These examples are relevant to understanding the sociospatial inequalities dramatized by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The authors discuss potential extensions of the technique to derive small-area estimates of variables observed in surveys other than the ACS.},

The developed framework encompasses multiple features of the EV charging grid behaviour, notably: (i) global predictions of the utilized energy, (ii) number of charging vehicles, and (iii) total time spent while charging. In this paper, we analyse framework performance and key performance indicator (KPI) values during the pre-lockdown period, soft-lockdown period, and post-lockdown lift-off period to show how the pandemic situations and governmental lockdown regulations can impact EV grid performance and EV charging business. In addition to that, we test a daily framework anomaly detection flow that tracks the global predictive performance of the predictive models on the EV grid, to detect if the framework detects this to be a situation that is novel (anomalous) during the soft-lockdown period. Results show that changes in the behaviour during the lockdown period reduce electric demand on EV charging spots, with customers having lower demand and similar behaviour as in other European countries. Furthermore, the soft-lockdown period is detected as a period with more extreme anomalous values for supervised models, and this is shown as an increase in residual anomaly values, flagging 3 times more days as an extreme anomaly than in the normal periods.},

The SAMPL challenges prospectively assess the predictive power of methods involved in computer-aided drug design. Application of various methods to fragment molecules are now widely used in the search for new drugs. However, there is little in the way of systematic validation specifically for fragment-based approaches. We have performed a large crystallographic high-throughput fragment screen against the therapeutically relevant second bromodomain of the Pleckstrin-homology domain interacting protein (PHIP2) that revealed 52 different fragments bound across 4 distinct sites, 47 of which were bound to the pharmacologically relevant acetylated lysine (Kac) binding site. These data were used to assess computational screening, binding pose prediction and follow-up enumeration. All submissions performed randomly for screening. Pose prediction success rates (defined as less than 2 Å root mean squared deviation against heavy atom crystal positions) ranged between 0 and 25% and only a very few follow-up compounds were deemed viable candidates from a medicinal-chemistry perspective based on a common molecular descriptors analysis. The tight deadlines imposed during the challenge led to a small number of submissions suggesting that the accuracy of rapidly responsive workflows remains limited. In addition, the application of these methods to reproduce crystallographic fragment data still appears to be very challenging. The results show that there is room for improvement in the development of computational tools particularly when applied to fragment-based drug design.},

In our attempts at sense-making of togetherness in a COVID-19/post-COVID-19 world, we believe it may be an oversimplification to conceptualise our daily data trails as ‘digital footprints’. The nature of our interaction with these technologies as well as their interaction with us have changed deeply ever since the rapid growth of digital connectivity. The character of these symbiotic relationships has been accentuated even more by our global experience of ‘connected disconnection’ during the pandemic’s lockdowns.

Moreover, the interaction with the expert, which represents an important component to gather verified and reliable input data for the ML algorithms, is weakly supported. To address all these issues, ORISHA, a platform for ORchestrated Information SHaring and Awareness enabling the cooperation among threat detection systems and other information awareness components, is proposed here. ORISHA is backed by a distributed Threat Intelligence Platform based on a network of interconnected Malware Information Sharing Platform instances, which enables the communication with several Threat Detection layers belonging to different organizations. Within this ecosystem, Threat Detection Systems mutually benefit by sharing knowledge that allows them to refine the underlying predictive accuracy. Uncertain cases, i.e. examples with low anomaly scores, are proposed to the expert, who acts with the role of oracle in an Active Learning scheme. By interfacing with a honeynet, ORISHA allows for enriching the knowledge base with further positive attack instances and then yielding robust detection models. An experimentation conducted on a well-known Intrusion Detection benchmark demonstrates the validity of the proposed architecture.},

To overcome this limitation, we exploit the strength of multiple CNNs by building an ensemble of classifiers via an optimized late fusion approach. To demonstrate the system’s robustness, we present different experiments on open source CXR datasets to simulate a real-world scenario, where scans of patients affected by various lung pathologies and coming from external datasets are tested. Promising performances are obtained both in cross-validation and in external validation, obtaining an average accuracy of 93.02% and 91.02%, respectively.},

   abstract = {The global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) has caused millions of deaths and affected the livelihood of many more people. Early and rapid detection of COVID‐19 is a challenging task for the medical community, but it is also crucial in stopping the spread of the SARS‐ CoV‐2 virus. Prior substantiation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields of science has encouraged researchers to further address this problem. Various medical imaging modalities including X‐ray, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) using AI techniques have greatly helped to curb the COVID‐19 outbreak by assisting with early diagnosis. We carried out a systematic review on state‐of‐the‐art AI techniques applied with X‐ray, CT, and US images to detect COVID‐19. In this paper, we discuss approaches used by various authors and the significance of these research efforts, the potential challenges, and future trends related to the implementation of an AI system for disease detection during the COVID‐19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {This thesis examines the problem of anomaly detection in evolving data. Data-driven anomaly detection methods typically build a model for the normal behavior of the target system and score each data instance with respect to this model. A threshold is invariably needed to identify data instances with high (or low) scores as anomalies. This presents a practical limitation on the applicability of such methods, since most methods are sensitive to the choice of the threshold, and it is challenging to set optimal thresholds. The issue is exacerbated in a streaming scenario, where the optimal thresholds vary with time.Furthermore, the methods lack the ability to scale to high-dimensional settings or timeseries databases. Anomaly detection for time series data is often aimed at identifying extreme behaviors within an individual time series. However, identifying extreme trends relative to a collection of other time series is of significant interest, like in the fields of public health policy, social justice and pandemic propagation.&nbsp;This thesis has 3 parts, the first two parts are two novel anomaly detection algorithms for evolving data and the third part is an application of the second anomaly detection method to neural networks. In the first part, we present a probabilistic framework to explicitly model the normal and anomalous behaviors and probabilistically reason about the data. An extreme value theory based formulation is proposed to model anomalous behavior as the extremes of normal behavior. As a specific instantiation, a joint non-parametric clustering and anomaly detection algorithm (INCAD) is proposed that models the normal behavior as a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model. Results on a variety of data sets, including streaming data, show that the proposed method provides effective and simultaneous clustering and anomaly detection without requiring strong initialization and threshold parameters.Since the INCAD model is unable to scale to time-series databases, we present a second algorithm in the second part of our thesis, Large Deviations Anomaly Detection (LAD), that can scale to large collections of time series data using the concepts from the theory of large deviations. Exploiting the ability of the algorithm to scale to high-dimensional data, we propose an online anomaly detection method to identify anomalies within individual time series and then to a collection of multivariate time series. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed Large Deviations Anomaly Detection (LAD) algorithm in identifying counties in the United States with anomalous trends in terms of COVID-19 related cases and deaths. Several of the identified anomalous counties correlate with counties with documented poor responses to the COVID pandemic.In the third part of this thesis, the computational efficiency of the LAD model is used to improve the training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) using our novel training algorithm. The aim of the novel training model, LAD Improved Iterative Training (LIIT), is to design a faster training approach using a smaller but better representative sample of the training data. We adopt the LAD anomaly scores to construct a series of Modified Training Samples (MTS) that are updated iteratively. The LIIT model incorporates ideas from Gradient Boosting methods to improve the learning process for the ANN. We present an extensive study on the performance of this training approach on simple clustering ANN as compared to the traditional training model and demonstrate the robustness of the LIIT approach to perturbations.},

   abstract = {Renewable energy integration is an effective measure to resolve environmental problems and implement sustainable development, yet the volatility of wind and solar generation has a profound impact on power system operation, calling for sufficient backup capacity. Energy storage can shift demand over time and mitigate real-time power mismatch and thus help integrate renewable energy resources into power grids. However, the unit capacity price of energy storage is still relatively high, and the capacity of energy storage is usually limited. Given the prominent uncertainty and finite capacity of energy storage, it is crucially important to take full advantage of energy storage units by strategic dispatch and control. From the mathematical point of view, energy storage dispatch and control give rise to a sequential decision-making process involving uncertain parameters and inter-temporal constraints. Multitudinous optimisation methods have been developed for such a problem while they differ in two aspects: the modelling of uncertainty and the mechanism to handle uncertainty. This review aims to draw a methodological picture of historical developments and state-of-the-art advances in this research field. These methods are subsumed into three major categories: multistage optimisation, online optimisation, and multi-timescale optimisation. In addition to introducing the advancements and applications, the authors also explain the motivations and theoretical foundations of these methodologies. The authors hope interested readers can attain a holistic outlook of these sophisticated approaches and choose the most appropriate one for their specific applications.},

   abstract = {Insecticide application is still a standard method in pest management. However, the current regions for insecticide application usually focus on the host of the pest but ignore the migration pathways, continually resulting in pests’ periodic outbreaks. This research provides a valuable modeling framework to identify optimal regions for insecticide application to solve this problem. This modeling framework optimizes insecticide areas based on habitat suitability and landscape connectivity, combining the MaxEnt and circuit theory. We conducted a case study in Beijing, China, to elucidate the application of this modeling framework. The input data included 517 occurrence points of Semiothisa cinerearia collected in the fieldwork and the environmental variables related to the eco-physiological characteristics of this species. The results indicated that the Chinese scholar tree (Styphnolobium japonicum) was the most vulnerable species. Increasing the pesticide region by 11.9% at some crucial corridors of the target species, the pest management effectiveness increased by 27.7%, compared with the pesticide applied only to the Chinese scholar trees. In summary, this study proposed a convenient and efficient modeling methodology for planning optimal regions for insecticide application.},

Due to the highly contagious nature, early detection of this virus plays a vital role to break Covid chain. Recent studies done by China says that chest CT and X-Ray image may be used as a preliminary test for Covid detection. Deep learning-based CNN model can use to detect Coronavirus automatically from the chest X-rays images. This paper proposed a transfer learning-based approach to detect Covid disease.

UAV's contribution is increasing in day-to-day life, whether it is in a military zone, disaster management, healthcare sector, smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), urban air mobility, and many more. In contrast, UAV's limited computational capability and low-energy sources pose significant challenges for real-time data processing, storage, networking, and security that are critical in emergencies such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones. UAVs are rapidly used to satisfy user requirements as well as services. As the demand for UAVs aided heterogeneous wireless networks increases in critical emergencies, fog computing serves several benefits to fulfill users' demands in terms of low latency, support, data storage, mobility, availability, scalability, and so on. This study aims to present a comprehensive study with their technical aspects for understanding fog computing, security issues, privacy concerns, and risks, along with its solutions. This paper suggests the collaboration of UAV-Fog architecture based on the four-tier network consisting of smart things, local UAVs, UAV-Fog, and cloud server, to control UAV's data and also described some of the security issues faced by this cloud infrastructure. Further, this research article also sheds new light on some scenarios of UAV-Fog for such deployments, applications, opportunities, challenges, and their major security threats and their countermeasures.

The performance of document clustering systems heavily relies on the optimal use of text representations. Vector space model is an extensively used technique by existing clustering algorithms to present the text in a structured form. However, such representations suffer from a lack of semantic associations, high dimensionality, and sparsity. In order to enrich the document representation by retaining the semantic and morphological associations, this paper introduced a word cluster-based modified term frequency-inverse document frequency (WC_MTI) model, in which semantically associated word embeddings from the word2vec are supplemented with morphological information using kernel principal component analysis. In addition, to address high dimensionality and sparsity issues and improve the clustering, we use a self-training technique that learns discriminative features using the WC_MTI model and autoencoder (AE) and then updates the encoder network weights using assignments from a clustering algorithm as supervision. The proposed model organizes documents into topically compatible clusters by maintaining the semantic and morphological similarity between terms using the skip-gram with negative sampling (SGNS) and low-dimensional vector representations. We evaluate the proposed approach against the existing text representation methods. Experimental findings suggest that the proposed approach enhanced the average accuracy by 89.62%.},

This expansion is rapidly growing every passing day in terms of the variety, heterogeneity and the number of devices which such applications support. Data collection is commonly the core application in WSN and IoT networks, which are typically composed of a large variety of devices, some constrained by their resources (e.g., processing, storage, energy) and some by highly diverse demands. Many challenges span all the conceptual communication layers, from the Physical to the Applicational. Many novel solutions devised in the past do not scale well with the exponential growth in the population of the devices and need to be adapted, revised, or new innovative solutions are required to comply with this massive growth. Furthermore, recent technological advances present new opportunities which can be leveraged in this context. This paper provides a cross-layer perspective and review of data gathering in WSN and IoT networks. We provide some background and essential milestones that have laid the foundation of many subsequent solutions suggested over the years.

   abstract = {Genetic recombination is an important driving force of coronavirus evolution. While some degree of virus recombination has been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, previously detected recombinant lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have shown limited circulation and been observed only in restricted areas. Prompted by reports of unusual genetic similarities among several Pango lineages detected mainly in North and Central America, we present a detailed phylogenetic analysis of four SARS-CoV-2 lineages (B.1.627, B.1.628, B.1.631 and B.1.634) in order to investigate the possibility of virus recombination among them. Two of these lineages, B.1.628 and B.1.631, are split into two distinct clusters (here named major and minor ). Our phylogenetic and recombination analyses of these lineages find well-supported phylogenetic differences between the Orf1ab region and the rest of the genome (S protein and remaining reading frames). The lineages also contain several deletions in the NSP6, Orf3a and S proteins that can augment reconstruction of reliable evolutionary histories. By reconciling the deletions and phylogenetic data, we conclude that the B.1.628 major cluster originated from a recombination event between a B.1.631 major virus and a lineage B.1.634 virus. This scenario inferred from genetic data is supported by the spatial and temporal distribution of the three lineages, which all co-circulated in the USA and Mexico during 2021, suggesting this region is where the recombination event took place. We therefore support the designation of the B.1.628 major cluster as recombinant lineage XB in the Pango nomenclature. The widespread circulation of lineage XB across multiple countries over a longer timespan than the previously designated recombinant XA lineage raises important questions regarding the role and potential effects of recombination on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

This biological process could lead to virus repression, serve as biomarkers for diagnosis, or as potential treatments for this disease. One source of concern is attempting to uncover the viral regions in which this binding could occur, as well as how these miRNAs binding could affect the SARS-COV-2 virus's processes. Using extracted sequence features from this base pairing, we predicted the relationships between miRNAs that interact with genes involved in immune function and bind to the SARS-COV-2 genome in their 5′ UTR region. We compared two supervised models, SVM and Random Forest, with an unsupervised One-Class SVM. When the results of the confusion matrices were inspected, the results of the supervised models were misleading, resulting in a Type II error. However, with the latter model, we achieved an average accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 96.18%, and specificity of 78%. We hypothesize that studying the bind of miRNAs that affect immunological genes and bind to the SARS-COV-2 virus will lead to potential genetic therapies for fighting the disease or understanding how the immune system is affected when this type of viral infection occurs.},

Testing the population via sampling has shown good results in slowing the epidemic spread. Sampling can be implemented at different times during the epidemic and may be done either per individual or for combined groups of people at a time. The work we present here makes two main contributions. We first extend and refine our scalable agent-based COVID-19 simulator to incorporate an improved socio-demographic model which considers professions, as well as a more realistic population mixing model based on contact matrices per country. These extensions are necessary to develop and test various sampling strategies in a scenario including the 62 largest cities in Spain; this is our second contribution. As part of the evaluation, we also analyze the impact of different parameters, such as testing frequency, quarantine time, percentage of quarantine breakers, or group testing, on sampling efficacy. Our results show that the most effective strategies are pooling, rapid antigen test campaigns, and requiring negative testing for access to public areas. The effectiveness of all these strategies can be greatly increased by reducing the number of contacts for infected individual.},

   abstract = {Introduction Assessing the impact of COVID-19 policy is critical for informing future policies. However, there are concerns about the overall strength of COVID-19 impact evaluation studies given the circumstances for evaluation and concerns about the publication environment. Methods We included studies that were primarily designed to estimate the quantitative impact of one or more implemented COVID-19 policies on direct SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 outcomes. After searching PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published on 26 November 2020 or earlier and screening, all studies were reviewed by three reviewers first independently and then to consensus. The review tool was based on previously developed and released review guidance for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation. Results After 102 articles were identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria, we identified 36 published articles that evaluated the quantitative impact of COVID-19 policies on direct COVID-19 outcomes. Nine studies were set aside because the study design was considered inappropriate for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation (n=8 pre/post; n=1 cross-sectional), and 27 articles were given a full consensus assessment. 20/27 met criteria for graphical display of data, 5/27 for functional form, 19/27 for timing between policy implementation and impact, and only 3/27 for concurrent changes to the outcomes. Only 4/27 were rated as overall appropriate. Including the 9 studies set aside, reviewers found that only four of the 36 identified published and peer-reviewed health policy impact evaluation studies passed a set of key design checks for identifying the causal impact of policies on COVID-19 outcomes. Discussion The reviewed literature directly evaluating the impact of COVID-19 policies largely failed to meet key design criteria for inference of sufficient rigour to be actionable by policy-makers. More reliable evidence review is needed to both identify and produce policy-actionable evidence, alongside the recognition that actionable evidence is often unlikely to be feasible.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To summarise the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) computer vision algorithms to classify ear disease from otoscopy. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Using the PRISMA guidelines, nine online databases were searched for articles that used AI computer vision algorithms developed from various methods (convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees and k-nearest neighbours) to classify otoscopic images. Diagnostic classes of interest: normal tympanic membrane, acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), chronic otitis media (COM) with or without perforation, cholesteatoma and canal obstruction. Main outcome measures: Accuracy to correctly classify otoscopic images compared to otolaryngologists (ground truth). The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies Version 2 tool was used to assess the quality of methodology and risk of bias. Results: Thirty-nine articles were included. Algorithms achieved 90.7% (95%CI: 90.1–91.3%) accuracy to difference between normal or abnormal otoscopy images in 14 studies. The most common multiclassification algorithm (3 or more diagnostic classes) achieved 97.6% (95%CI: 97.3–97.9%) accuracy to differentiate between normal, AOM and OME in three studies. AI algorithms outperformed human assessors to classify otoscopy images achieving 93.4% (95%CI: 90.5–96.4%) versus 73.2% (95%CI: 67.9–78.5%) accuracy in three studies. Convolutional neural networks achieved the highest accuracy compared to other classification methods. Conclusion: AI can classify ear disease from otoscopy. A concerted effort is required to establish a comprehensive and reliable otoscopy database for algorithm training. An AI-supported otoscopy system may assist health care workers, trainees and primary care practitioners with less otology experience identify ear disease.},

   abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) have become a common tool for estimating demand for hospital beds during the COVID-19 pandemic. A key parameter in these ABMs is the probability of hospitalization for agents with COVID-19. Many published COVID-19 ABMs use either single point or age-specific estimates of the probability of hospitalization for agents with COVID-19, omitting key factors: comorbidities and testing status (i.e., received vs. did not receive COVID-19 test). These omissions can inhibit interpretability, particularly by stakeholders seeking to use an ABM for transparent decision-making. We introduce a straightforward yet novel application of Bayes' theorem with inputs from aggregated hospital data to better incorporate these factors in an ABM. We update input parameters for a North Carolina COVID-19 ABM using this approach, demonstrate sensitivity to input data selections, and highlight the enhanced interpretability and accuracy of the method and the predictions. We propose that even in tumultuous scenarios with limited information like the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, straightforward approaches like this one with discrete, attainable inputs can improve ABMs to better support stakeholders.},

Currently, the challenges are to (1) obtain a consolidated view of various stakeholders and pain points for the entire disease lifecycle, (2) identify interdependencies between different stages of the disease, and (3) prioritize solutions based on customer needs. A structured approach is required to address clinical needs across disease care plans tailored to different geographies and ethnicities. Innovation Think Tank (ITT) teams across multiple locations formed focus groups to elaborate the pathways of 22 global diseases, selected based on ranking of associated economic burden and threat to life. Ideation sessions were held to identify pain points and find innovative solutions. Additionally, inputs were taken from co-creation sessions at universities worldwide. The optimization and design of infographics and care plan was done based on the key information gathered—facts and figures, stakeholders, pain points and solutions. Finally, validation was obtained from clinical and technology experts globally. A disease pathway framework was created to develop pathways for 22 global diseases. Over 1,500 pain points were collected and about 1,900 ideas were proposed. The approach was applied to optimize its application to 30 product and portfolio definition projects over 2 years at Siemens Healthineers, as well as co-creation programs with universities and hospitals. The disease pathway framework provides a unique foundation for extensive collaboration among multiple stakeholders, through information sharing and delivering high-quality solutions based on the identified problems and customer needs.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic confronts governments and their health systems with great challenges for disease management. In many countries, hospitalization and in particular ICU occupancy is the primary measure for policy makers to decide on possible non-pharmaceutical interventions. In this paper a combined methodology for the prediction of COVID-19 case numbers, case-specific hospitalization and ICU admission rates as well as hospital and ICU occupancies is proposed. To this end, we employ differential flatness to provide estimates of the states of an epidemiological compartmental model and estimates of the unknown exogenous inputs driving its nonlinear dynamics. A main advantage of this method is that it requires the reported infection cases as the only data source. As vaccination rates and case-specific ICU rates are both strongly age-dependent, specifically an age-structured compartmental model is proposed to estimate and predict the spread of the epidemic across different age groups. By utilizing these predictions, case-specific hospitalization and case-specific ICU rates are subsequently estimated using deconvolution techniques. In an analysis of various countries we demonstrate how the methodology is able to produce real-time state estimates and hospital/ICU occupancy predictions for several weeks thus providing a sound basis for policy makers.},

   abstract = {Can satisfactory explanations for complex machine learning models be achieved in high-risk automated decision-making? How can such explanations be integrated into a data protection framework safeguarding a right to explanation? This article explores from an interdisciplinary point of view the connection between existing legal requirements for the explainability of AI systems set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the current state of the art in the field of explainable AI. It studies the challenges of providing human legible explanations for current and future AI-based decision-making systems in practice, based on two scenarios of automated decision-making in credit scoring risks and medical diagnosis of COVID-19. These scenarios exemplify the trend towards increasingly complex machine learning algorithms in automated decision-making, both in terms of data and models. Current machine learning techniques, in particular those based on deep learning, are unable to make clear causal links between input data and final decisions. This represents a limitation for providing exact, human-legible reasons behind specific decisions, and presents a serious challenge to the provision of satisfactory, fair and transparent explanations. Therefore, the conclusion is that the quality of explanations might not be considered as an adequate safeguard for automated decision-making processes under the GDPR. Accordingly, additional tools should be considered to complement explanations. These could include algorithmic impact assessments, other forms of algorithmic justifications based on broader AI principles, and new technical developments in trustworthy AI. This suggests that eventually all of these approaches would need to be considered as a whole.},

   abstract = {To identify Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases efficiently, affordably, and at scale, recent work has shown how audio (including cough, breathing and voice) based approaches can be used for testing. However, there is a lack of exploration of how biases and methodological decisions impact these tools’ performance in practice. In this paper, we explore the realistic performance of audio-based digital testing of COVID-19. To investigate this, we collected a large crowdsourced respiratory audio dataset through a mobile app, alongside symptoms and COVID-19 test results. Within the collected dataset, we selected 5240 samples from 2478 English-speaking participants and split them into participant-independent sets for model development and validation. In addition to controlling the language, we also balanced demographics for model training to avoid potential acoustic bias. We used these audio samples to construct an audio-based COVID-19 prediction model. The unbiased model took features extracted from breathing, coughs and voice signals as predictors and yielded an AUC-ROC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65–0.77). We further explored several scenarios with different types of unbalanced data distributions to demonstrate how biases and participant splits affect the performance. With these different, but less appropriate, evaluation strategies, the performance could be overestimated, reaching an AUC up to 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85–0.95) in some circumstances. We found that an unrealistic experimental setting can result in misleading, sometimes over-optimistic, performance. Instead, we reported complete and reliable results on crowd-sourced data, which would allow medical professionals and policy makers to accurately assess the value of this technology and facilitate its deployment.},

One major challenge that limits the applicability of AA in practice is the inherent computational complexity of the existing algorithms. In this paper, we provide a novel approximation approach to partially address this issue. Utilizing probabilistic ideas from high-dimensional geometry, we introduce two preprocessing techniques to reduce the dimension and representation cardinality of the data, respectively. We prove that provided data are approximately embedded in a low-dimensional linear subspace and the convex hull of the corresponding representations is well approximated by a polytope with a few vertices, our method can effectively reduce the scaling of AA. Moreover, the solution of the reduced problem is near-optimal in terms of prediction errors. Our approach can be combined with other acceleration techniques to further mitigate the intrinsic complexity of AA. We demonstrate the usefulness of our results by applying our method to summarize several moderately large-scale datasets.},

   abstract = {The identification of clayey soil desiccation cracks is an important practical issue in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. The desiccation cracks can dramatically increase the hydraulic conductivity and deteriorate the mechanical performances of clayey soils. Traditionally, the analysis of soil desiccation cracks relies on visual inspection and image processing techniques, which lack automation and intelligence. Therefore, there is an increasing need for an automated algorithm to meet accuracy and efficiency requirements for various engineering scenarios. In this study, a state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, Mask R-CNN, was utilized for the clayey soil crack detection, localization and segmentation. A comprehensive dataset including 1200 annotated crack images of 256 × 256 resolution was prepared for the algorithm training and validation. The proposed Mask R-CNN algorithm achieved precision, recall and F1 score of 73.29%, 82.76% and 77.74%, respectively. Besides, the algorithm gained a mean localization accuracy (APbb) of 64.14% and a mean segmentation accuracy (APm) of 47.59%. The detection performance of the Mask R-CNN was also compared with that of the U-Net under three different scenarios. The test results have demonstrated the superiority of the Mask R-CNN over the U-Net algorithm in crack detection, localization and segmentation.},

Exploring the possible antigenic evolutionary potentials improves public health preparedness, but it is limited by the lack of experimental assays as the sequence space is exponentially large. Here we introduce the Machine Learning-guided Antigenic Evolution Prediction (MLAEP), which combines structure modeling, multi-task learning, and genetic algorithm to model the viral fitness landscape and explore the antigenic evolution via in silico directed evolution. As demonstrated by existing SARS-COV-2 variants, MLEAP can infer the order of variants along antigenic evolutionary trajectories, which is also strongly correlated with their sampling time. The novel mutations predicted by MLEAP are also found in immunocompromised covid patients and newly emerging variants, like BA. 4/5. In sum, our approach enables profiling existing variants and forecasting prospective antigenic variants, thus may help guide the development of vaccines and increase preparedness against future variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

It is necessary to understand the development of its research hot spots as well as directions for future research. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the evolution of medical informatics research topics by analyzing research articles published between 1964 and 2020. Methods: A total of 56,466 publications were collected from 27 representative medical informatics journals indexed by the Web of Science Core Collection. We identified the research stages based on the literature growth curve, extracted research topics using the latent Dirichlet allocation model, and analyzed topic evolution patterns by calculating the cosine similarity between topics from the adjacent stages. Results: The following three research stages were identified: early birth, early development, and rapid development. Medical informatics has entered the fast development stage, with literature growing exponentially. Research topics in medical informatics can be classified into the following two categories: data-centered studies and people-centered studies. Medical data analysis has been a research hot spot across all 3 stages, and the integration of emerging technologies into data analysis might be a future hot spot. Researchers have focused more on user needs in the last 2 stages. Another potential hot spot might be how to meet user needs and improve the usability of health tools.

   abstract = {The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 has imposed clinical and financial burdens on hospitals and governments attempting to provide patients with medical care and implement disease-controlling policies. The transmissibility of the disease was shown to be correlated with the patient&rsquo;s viral load, which can be measured during testing using the cycle threshold (Ct). Previous models have utilized Ct to forecast the trajectory of the spread, which can provide valuable information to better allocate resources and change policies. However, these models combined other variables specific to medical institutions or came in the form of compartmental models that rely on epidemiological assumptions, all of which could impose prediction uncertainties. In this study, we overcome these limitations using data-driven modeling that utilizes Ct and previous number of cases, two institution-independent variables. We collected three groups of patients (n = 6296, n = 3228, and n = 12,096) from different time periods to train, validate, and independently validate the models. We used three machine learning algorithms and three deep learning algorithms that can model the temporal dynamic behavior of the number of cases. The endpoint was 7-week forward number of cases, and the prediction was evaluated using mean square error (MSE). The sequence-to-sequence model showed the best prediction during validation (MSE = 0.025), while polynomial regression (OLS) and support vector machine regression (SVR) had better performance during independent validation (MSE = 0.1596, and MSE = 0.16754, respectively), which exhibited better generalizability of the latter. The OLS and SVR models were used on a dataset from an external institution and showed promise in predicting COVID-19 incidences across institutions. These models may support clinical and logistic decision-making after prospective validation.},

   abstract = {The course of COVID-19 is unpredictable, ranging from asymptomatic to respiratory failure and death. Prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. We hypothesized that long pentraxin PTX3 could be a valuable plasma biomarker due to its essential role in inflammatory processes. In a prospective hospitalized COVID-19 derivation cohort (n = 126) during the spring of 2020, we measured PTX3 within 4 days of admission. The predictive value of mechanical ventilation (MV) and 30-day mortality compared with clinical parameters and other markers of inflammation were assessed by logistic regression analysis and expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Analyses were repeated in a prospective validation cohort (n = 112) of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. Thirty-day mortality in the derivation cohort was 26.2%. In patients who died, the median PTX3 concentration upon admission was 19.5 ng/mL (IQR: 12.5-33.3) versus 6.6 ng/mL (IQR 2.9-12.3) (p < 0.0001) for survivors. After adjustment for covariates, the odds of 30-day mortality increased two-fold for each doubling of PTX3 (OR 2.03 [95% CI: 1.23-3.34], p = 0.006), which was also observed in the validation cohort (OR 1.70 [95% CI: 1.09-2.67], p = 0.02). Similarly, PTX3 levels were associated with MV. After adjustment for covariates, OR of MV was 2.34 (95% CI: 1.33-4.12, p = 0.003) in the derivation cohort and 1.64 (95% CI: 1.03-2.62, p = 0.04) in the validation cohort. PTX3 appears to be a useful clinical biomarker to predict 30-day respiratory failure and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients treated with and without remdesivir and dexamethasone.},

   abstract = {Social media commentary, satellite imagery and GPS data are a part of ‘alternative data’, that is, data that originate outside of the standard repertoire of market data but are considered useful for predicting stock prices, detecting different risk exposures and discovering new price movement indicators. With the availability of sophisticated machine-learning analytics tools, alternative data are gaining traction within the investment management and algorithmic trading industries. Drawing on interviews with people working in investment management and algorithmic trading firms utilizing alternative data, as well as firms providing and sourcing such data, we emphasize social media-based sentiment analytics as one manifestation of how alternative data are deployed for stock price prediction purposes. This demonstrates both how sentiment analytics are developed and subsequently utilized by investment management firms. We argue that ‘alternative data’ are an open-ended placeholder for every data source potentially relevant for investment management purposes and harnessing these disparate data sources requires certain standardization efforts by different market participants. Besides showing how market participants understand and use alternative data, we demonstrate that alternative data often undergo processes of (a) prospecting (i.e. rendering such data amenable to processing with the aid of analytics tools) and (b) assetization (i.e. the transformation of data into tradable assets). We further contend that the widespread embracement of alternative data in investment management and trading encourages a financialization process at the data level which raises new governance issues.},

   abstract = {Representation learning approaches require a massive amount of discriminative training data, which is unavailable in many scenarios, such as healthcare, smart city, and education. In practice, people refer to crowdsourcing to get annotated labels. However, due to issues like data privacy, budget limitation, shortage of domain-specific annotators, the number of crowdsourced labels is still very limited. Moreover, because of annotators’ diverse expertise, crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent. Thus, directly applying existing supervised representation learning (SRL) algorithms may easily get the overfitting problem and yield suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose NeuCrowd, a unified framework for SRL from crowdsourced labels. The proposed framework (1) creates a sufficient number of high-quality n-tuplet training samples by utilizing safety-aware sampling and robust anchor generation; and (2) automatically learns a neural sampling network that adaptively learns to select effective samples for SRL networks. The proposed framework is evaluated on both one synthetic and three real-world data sets. The results show that our approach outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and AUC.

   abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has demonstrated tremendous success in various mission-critical large-scale scenarios. However, such promising distributed learning paradigm is still vulnerable to privacy inference and byzantine attacks. The former aims to infer the privacy of target participants involved in training, while the latter focuses on destroying the integrity of the constructed model. To mitigate the above two issues, a few works recently explored unified solutions by utilizing generic secure computation techniques and common byzantine-robust aggregation rules, but there are two major limitations: 1) they suffer from impracticality due to efficiency bottlenecks, and 2) they are still vulnerable to various types of attacks because of model incomprehensiveness. To approach the above problems, in this paper, we present SecureFL, an efficient, private and byzantine-robust FL framework. SecureFL follows the state-of-the-art byzantine-robust FL method (FLTrust NDSS’21), which performs comprehensive byzantine defense by normalizing the updates’ magnitude and measuring directional similarity, adapting it to the privacy-preserving context. More importantly, we carefully customize a series of cryptographic components. First, we design a crypto-friendly validity checking protocol that functionally replaces the normalization operation in FLTrust, and further devise tailored cryptographic protocols on top of it. Benefiting from the above optimizations, the communication and computation costs are reduced by half without sacrificing the robustness and privacy protection. Second, we develop a novel preprocessing technique for costly matrix multiplication. With this technique, the directional similarity measurement can be evaluated securely with negligible computation overhead and zero communication cost. Extensive evaluations conducted on three real-world datasets and various neural network architectures demonstrate that SecureFL outperforms prior art up to two orders of magnitude in efficiency with state-of-the-art byzantine robustness.},

   abstract = {Technosignatures refer to observational manifestations of technology that could be detected through astronomical means. Most previous searches for technosignatures have focused on searches for radio signals, but many current and future observing facilities could also constrain the prevalence of some non-radio technosignatures. This search could thus benefit from broader participation by the astronomical community, as contributions to technosignature science can also take the form of negative results that provide statistically meaningful quantitative upper limits on the presence of a signal. This paper provides a synthesis of the recommendations of the 2020 TechnoClimes workshop, which was an online event intended to develop a research agenda to prioritize and guide future theoretical and observational studies technosignatures. The paper provides a high-level overview of the use of current and future missions to detect exoplanetary technosignatures at ultraviolet, optical, or infrared wavelengths, which specifically focuses on the detectability of atmospheric technosignatures, artificial surface modifications, optical beacons, space engineering and megastructures, and interstellar flight. This overview does not derive any new quantitative detection limits but is intended to provide additional science justification for the use of current and planned observing facilities as well as to inspire astronomers conducting such observations to consider the relevance of their ongoing observations to technosignature science. This synthesis also identifies possible technology gaps with the ability of current and planned missions to search for technosignatures, which suggests the need to consider technosignature science cases in the design of future mission concepts.},

Big and open data offer considerable potential for analyzing and predicting human mobility during disaster events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to better disaster risk reduction (DRR) planning. However, the value of human mobility data and analysis (HMDA) in urban resilience research is poorly understood. This review highlights key opportunities for and challenges hindering the use of HMDA in DRR in urban planning and risk science, as well as insights from practitioners. A gap in research on HMDA for data-driven DRR planning was identified. By examining human mobility studies and their respective analytical and planning tools, this paper offers deeper insights into the challenges that must be addressed to improve the development of effective data-driven DRR planning, from data collection to implementation. In future work on HMDA, (i) the human mobility of vulnerable populations should be targeted, (ii) research should focus on disaster mitigation and prevention, (iii) analytical methods for evidence-based disaster planning should be developed, (iv) different types of data should be integrated into analyses to overcome methodological challenges, and (v) a decision-making framework should be developed for evidence-based urban planning through transdisciplinary knowledge co-production.},

It consists of an emerging viral infection with respiratory tropism that could develop atypical pneumonia. Experts emphasize the importance of early detection of those who have the COVID-19 virus. In this way, patients will be isolated from other people and the spread of the virus can be prevented. For this reason, it has become an area of interest to develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a rapid treatment process and prevent the virus from spreading. Since the standard testing system is time-consuming and not available for everyone, alternative early screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this study, the approaches used in the detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning (DL) algorithms, which have been popular in recent years, have been comprehensively discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches used in literature are examined in detail. We further present the databases and major future challenges of DL-based COVID-19 detection. The computed tomography of the chest and X-ray images gives a rich representation of the patient’s lung that is less time-consuming and allows an efficient viral pneumonia detection using the DL algorithms. The first step is the preprocessing of these images to remove noise. Next, deep features are extracted using multiple types of deep models (pretrained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc.). Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide whether the patient is infected by coronavirus or it is another lung disease. In this study, we also give a brief review of the latest applications of cough analysis to early screen the COVID-19 and human mobility estimation to limit its spread.},

   abstract = {Since the COVID-19 pandemic, several research studies have proposed Deep Learning (DL)-based automated COVID-19 detection, reporting high cross-validation accuracy when classifying COVID-19 patients from normal or other common Pneumonia. Although the reported outcomes are very high in most cases, these results were obtained without an independent test set from a separate data source(s). DL models are likely to overfit training data distribution when independent test sets are not utilized or are prone to learn dataset-specific artifacts rather than the actual disease characteristics and underlying pathology. This study aims to assess the promise of such DL methods and datasets by investigating the key challenges and issues by examining the compositions of the available public image datasets and designing different experimental setups. A convolutional neural network-based network, called CVR-Net (COVID-19 Recognition Network), has been proposed for conducting comprehensive experiments to validate our hypothesis. The presented end-to-end CVR-Net is a multi-scale-multi-encoder ensemble model that aggregates the outputs from two different encoders and their different scales to convey the final prediction probability. Three different classification tasks, such as 2-, 3-, 4-classes, are designed where the train–test datasets are from the single, multiple, and independent sources. The obtained binary classification accuracy is 99.8% for a single train–test data source, where the accuracies fall to 98.4% and 88.7% when multiple and independent train–test data sources are utilized. Similar outcomes are noticed in multi-class categorization tasks for single, multiple, and independent data sources, highlighting the challenges in developing DL models with the existing public datasets without an independent test set from a separate dataset. Such a result concludes a requirement for a better-designed dataset for developing DL tools applicable in actual clinical settings. The dataset should have an independent test set; for a single machine or hospital source, have a more balanced set of images for all the prediction classes; and have a balanced dataset from several hospitals and demography. Our source codes and model are publicly available1 for the research community for further improvements.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a pressing need for integrating information from disparate sources in order to assist decision makers. Social media is important in this respect; however, to make sense of the textual information it provides and be able to automate the processing of large amounts of data, natural language processing methods are needed. Social media posts are often noisy, yet they may provide valuable insights regarding the severity and prevalence of the disease in the population. Here, we adopt a triage and diagnosis approach to analyzing social media posts using machine learning techniques for the purpose of disease detection and surveillance. We thus obtain useful prevalence and incidence statistics to identify disease symptoms and their severities, motivated by public health concerns. Objective: This study aims to develop an end-to-end natural language processing pipeline for triage and diagnosis of COVID-19 from patient-authored social media posts in order to provide researchers and public health practitioners with additional information on the symptoms, severity, and prevalence of the disease rather than to provide an actionable decision at the individual level. Methods: The text processing pipeline first extracted COVID-19 symptoms and related concepts, such as severity, duration, negations, and body parts, from patients' posts using conditional random fields. An unsupervised rule-based algorithm was then applied to establish relations between concepts in the next step of the pipeline. The extracted concepts and relations were subsequently used to construct 2 different vector representations of each post. These vectors were separately applied to build support vector machine learning models to triage patients into 3 categories and diagnose them for COVID-19. Results: We reported macro- and microaveraged F1 scores in the range of 71%-96% and 61%-87%, respectively, for the triage and diagnosis of COVID-19 when the models were trained on human-labeled data. Our experimental results indicated that similar performance can be achieved when the models are trained using predicted labels from concept extraction and rule-based classifiers, thus yielding end-to-end machine learning. In addition, we highlighted important features uncovered by our diagnostic machine learning models and compared them with the most frequent symptoms revealed in another COVID-19 data set. In particular, we found that the most important features are not always the most frequent ones. Conclusions: Our preliminary results show that it is possible to automatically triage and diagnose patients for COVID-19 from social media natural language narratives, using a machine learning pipeline in order to provide information on the severity and prevalence of the disease for use within health surveillance systems.},

We, then, performed point-biserial and spearman correlation analysis over the collected data. Our analysis of the obtained correlations demonstrates that various disease outbreak attributes are positively and negatively correlated with different socioeconomic indicators. For example, indicators such as lifetime risk of maternal death, adolescent fertility rate, etc., are positively correlated, while indicators such as life expectancy at birth, measles immunization, etc., are negatively correlated, with disease outbreaks that affect the digestive organ system. In this paper, we find and summarize the correlations between 126 outbreak attributes derived from the characteristics of the 72 diseases in consideration and 192 socioeconomic factors which is a novel contribution to the field of disease outbreak analysis and prediction.},

They can also be useful and effective in fighting the spread of infectious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though young adults are the most prevalent mHealth user group, the relevant literature has overlooked their intention to invest in and use mHealth services. This study aims to investigate the predictors that influence young adults’ intention to invest in mHealth (IINmH), particularly during the COVID-19 crisis, by designing a research methodology that incorporates both the health belief model (HBM) and the expectation-confirmation model (ECM). As an expansion of the integrated HBM-ECM model, this study proposes two additional predictors: mobile Internet speed and mobile Internet cost. A multi-method analytical approach, including partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and machine learning (ML), was utilised together with a sample dataset of 558 respondents. The dataset—about young adults in Bangladesh with an experience of using mHealth—was obtained through a structured questionnaire to examine the complex causal relationships of the integrated model. The findings from PLS-SEM indicate that value-for-money, mobile Internet cost, health motivation, and confirmation of services all have a substantial impact on young adults’ IINmH during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the fsQCA results indicate that a combination of predictors, instead of any individual predictor, had a significant impact on predicting IINmH. Among ML methods, the XGBoost classifier outperformed other classifiers in predicting the IINmH, which was then used to perform sensitivity analysis to determine the relevance of features. We expect this multi-method analytical approach to make a significant contribution to the mHealth domain as well as the broad information systems literature.},

This is especially relevant for products with a short shelf life due to the potential disposal of unsold items. Horticultural products are highly influenced by this, however with limited attention in forecasting research so far. Beyond that, many forecasting competitions show a competitive performance of classical forecasting methods. For the first time, we empirically compared the performance of nine state-of-the-art machine learning and three classical forecasting algorithms for horticultural sales predictions. We show that machine learning methods were superior in all our experiments, with the gradient boosted ensemble learner XGBoost being the top performer in 14 out of 15 comparisons. This advantage over classical forecasting approaches increased for datasets with multiple seasons. Further, we show that including additional external factors, such as weather and holiday information, as well as meta-features led to a boost in predictive performance. In addition, we investigated whether the algorithms can capture the sudden increase in demand of horticultural products during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020. For this special case, XGBoost was also superior. All code and data is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/grimmlab/HorticulturalSalesPredictions.},

   abstract = {Recently, there has been an increasing need for new applications and services such as big data, blockchains, vehicle-to-everything (V2X), the Internet of things, 5G, and beyond. Therefore, to maintain quality of service (QoS), accurate network resource planning and forecasting are essential steps for resource allocation. This study proposes a reliable hybrid dynamic bandwidth slice forecasting framework that combines the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and local smoothing methods to improve the network forecasting model. Moreover, the proposed framework can dynamically react to all the changes occurring in the data series. Backbone traffic was used to validate the proposed method. As a result, the forecasting accuracy improved significantly with the proposed framework and with minimal data loss from the smoothing process. The results showed that the hybrid moving average LSTM (MLSTM) achieved the most remarkable improvement in the training and testing forecasts, with 28% and 24% for long-term evolution (LTE) time series and with 35% and 32% for the multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) time series, respectively, while robust locally weighted scatter plot smoothing and LSTM (RLWLSTM) achieved the most significant improvement for upstream traffic with 45%; moreover, the dynamic learning framework achieved improvement percentages that can reach up to 100%.},

   abstract = {Snap bean production was valued at 363 million in 2018. Moreover, the increasing need in food production, caused by the exponential increase in population, makes this crop vitally important to study. Traditionally, harvest time determination and yield prediction are performed by collecting limited number of samples. While this approach could work, it is inaccurate, labor-intensive, and based on a small sample size. The ambiguous nature of this approach furthermore leaves the grower with under-ripe and over-mature plants, decreasing the final net profit and the overall quality of the product. A more cost-effective method would be a site-specific approach that would save time and labor for farmers and growers, while providing them with exact detail to when and where to harvest and how much is to be harvested (while forecasting yield). In this study we used hyperspectral (i.e., point-based and image-based), as well as biophysical data, to identify spectral signatures and biophysical attributes that could schedule harvest and forecast yield prior to harvest. Over the past two decades, there have been immense advances in the field of yield and harvest modeling using remote sensing data. Nevertheless, there still exists a wide gap in the literature covering yield and harvest assessment as a function of time using both ground-based and unmanned aerial systems. There is a need for a study focusing on crop-specific yield and harvest assessment using a rapid, affordable system. We hypothesize that a down-sampled multispectral system, tuned with spectral features identified from hyperspectral data, could address the mentioned gaps. Moreover, we hypothesize that the airborne data will contain noise that could negatively impact the performance and the reliability of the utilized models. Thus, We address these knowledge gaps with three objectives as below:1. Assess yield prediction of snap bean crop using spectral and biophysical data and identify discriminating spectral features via statistical and machine learning approaches.2. Evaluate snap bean harvest maturity at both the plant growth stage and pod maturity level, by means of spectral and biophysical indicators, and identify the corresponding discriminating spectral features.3. Assess the feasibility of using a deep learning architecture for reducing noise in the hyperspectral data.In the light of the mentioned objectives, we carried out a greenhouse study in the winter and spring of 2019, where we studied temporal change in spectra and physical attributes of snap-bean crop, from Huntington cultivar, using a handheld spectrometer in the visible- to shortwave-infrared domain (400-2500 nm). Chapter 3 of this dissertation focuses on yield assessment of the greenhouse study. Findings from this best-case scenario yield study showed that the best time to study yield is approximately 20-25 days prior to harvest that would give out the most accurate yield predictions. The proposed approach was able to explain variability as high as R2 = 0.72, with spectral features residing in absorption regions for chlorophyll, protein, lignin, and nitrogen, among others. The captured data from this study contained minimal noise, even in the detector fall-off regions. Moving the focus to harvest maturity assessment, Chapter 4 presents findings from this objective in the greenhouse environment. Our findings showed that four stages of maturity, namely vegetative growth, budding, flowering, and pod formation, are distinguishable with 79% and 78% accuracy, respectively, via the two introduced vegetation indices, as snap-bean growth index (SGI) and normalized difference snap-bean growth index (NDSI), respectively. Moreover, pod-level maturity classification showed that ready-to-harvest and not-ready-to-harvest pods can be separated with 78% accuracy with identified wavelengths residing in green, red edge, and shortwave-infrared regions.Moreover, Chapters 5 and 6 focus on transitioning the learned concepts from the mentioned greenhouse scenario to UAS domain. We transitioned from a handheld spectrometer in the visible to short-wave infrared domain (400-2500 nm) to a UAS-mounted hyperspectral imager in the visible-to-near-infrared region (400-1000 nm). Two years worth of data, at two different geographical locations, were collected in upstate New York and examined for yield modeling and harvest scheduling objectives. For analysis of the collected data, we introduced a feature selection library in Python, named "Jostar", to identify the most discriminating wavelengths. The findings from the yield modeling UAS study show that pod weight and seed length, as two different yield indicators, can be explained with R2 as high as 0.93 and 0.98, respectively. Identified wavelengths resided in blue, green, red, and red edge regions, and 44-55 days after planting (DAP) showed to be the optimal time for yield assessment. Chapter 6, on the other hand, evaluates maturity assessment, in terms of pod classification, from the UAS perspective. Results from this study showed that the identified features resided in blue, green, red, and red-edge regions, contributing to F1 score as high as 0.91 for differentiating between ready-to-harvest vs. not ready-to-harvest. The identified features from this study is in line with those detected from the UAS yield assessment study.In order to have a parallel comparison of the greenhouse study against the UAS study, we adopted the methodology employed for UAS studies and applied it to the greenhouse studies, in Chapter 7. Since the greenhouse data were captured in the visible-to-shortwave-infrared(400-2500 nm) domain, and the UAS study data were captured in the VNIR (400-1000 nm)domain, we truncated the spectral range of the collected data from the greenhouse study to the VNIR domain. The comparison experiment between the greenhouse study and the UAS studies for yield assessment, at two harvest stages early and late, showed that spectral features in 450-470, 500-520, 650, 700-730 nm regions were repeated on days with highest coefficient of determination. Moreover, 46-48 DAP with high coefficient of determination for yield prediction were repeated in five out of six data sets (two early stages, each three datasets). On the other hand, the harvest maturity comparison between the greenhouse study and the UAS data sets showed that similar identified wavelengths reside in ∼450, ∼530,∼715, and ∼760 nm regions, with performance metric (F1 score) of 0.78, 0.84, and 0.9 for greenhouse, 2019 UAS, and 2020 UAS data, respectively.However, the incorporated noise in the captured data from the UAS study, along with the high computational cost of the classical mathematical approach employed for denoising hyperspectral data, have inspired us to leverage the computational performance of hyperspectral denoising by assessing the feasibility of transferring the learned concepts to deep learning models. In Chapter 8, we approached hyperspectral denoising in spectral domain(1D fashion) for two types of noise, integrated noise and non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) noise. We utilized Memory Networks due to their power in image denoising for hyperspectral denoising, introduced a new loss and benchmarked it against several data sets and models. The proposed model, HypeMemNet, ranked first - up to 40% in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for resolving integrated noise, and first or second, by a small margin for resolving non-i.i.d. noise. Our findings showed that a proper receptive field and a suitable number of filters are crucial for denoising integrated noise, while parameter size was shown to be of the highest importance for non-i.i.d. noise.Results from the conducted studies provide a comprehensive understanding encompassing yield modeling, harvest scheduling, and hyperspectral denoising. Our findings bode well for transitioning from an expensive hyperspectral imager to a multispectral imager, tuned with the identified bands, as well as employing a rapid deep learning model for hyperspectral denoising.},

   abstract = {The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) struck without warning, and existing medical screening and clinical management systems were unprepared, causing a high fatality rate. Given the virus’s ongoing evolution, there is still a potential for reemergence; earlier weak preparedness will not be accepted in such a situation. Therefore, it is vital to understand and rectify past diagnostic work’s flaws. RT-PCR and antigen tests, both widely used, have experienced problems in the past. They either were too sluggish or produced an excessive number of false negatives. Another issue was a lack of test kits. As a result, chest X-ray image-based disease classification has emerged. However, managing a variety of chest X-ray pictures for COVID-19 and pneumonia patients is complicated and error-prone. As a result, the only way to improve the current diagnosis is to apply deep learning algorithms that learn from radiography pictures and anticipate COVID-19 development. We constructed our own convolutional neural network (CNN) by incorporating transfer learning from the most popular ResNet, VGG, and InceptionNet models. The endeavor necessitated the creation of a sizable dataset that accurately depicted the patient population. Before importing the model, the images were enhanced to remove artifacts caused by noise, motion, or blurring that could impair the detection of infection. Preprocessing has a substantial impact on the model’s accuracy. The results indicated that the VGG16 architecture, with a detection accuracy of 95.29%, is optimal for COVID-19 identification from X-ray images. Furthermore, most generated models outperformed current state-of-the-art research in the same field.},

   abstract = {Background: Research on the diagnosis of COVID-19 using lung images is limited by the scarcity of imaging data. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are popular for synthesis and data augmentation. GANs have been explored for data augmentation to enhance the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19 within lung computed tomography (CT) and X-ray images. However, the role of GANs in overcoming data scarcity for COVID-19 is not well understood. Objective: This review presents a comprehensive study on the role of GANs in addressing the challenges related to COVID-19 data scarcity and diagnosis. It is the first review that summarizes different GAN methods and lung imaging data sets for COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of GANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the availability of source code. Methods: A search was conducted on 5 databases, namely PubMed, IEEEXplore, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from October 11-13, 2021. The search was conducted using intervention keywords, such as ``generative adversarial networks'' and ``GANs,'' and application keywords, such as ``COVID-19'' and ``coronavirus.'' The review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines for systematic and scoping reviews. Only those studies were included that reported GAN-based methods for analyzing chest X-ray images, chest CT images, and chest ultrasound images. Any studies that used deep learning methods but did not use GANs were excluded. No restrictions were imposed on the country of publication, study design, or outcomes. Only those studies that were in English and were published from 2020 to 2022 were included. No studies before 2020 were included. Results: This review included 57 full-text studies that reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lung imaging data. Most of the studies (n=42, 74%) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications of GANs were segmentation of lungs and superresolution of lung images. The cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures, used in 9 studies each. In addition, 29 (51%) studies used chest X-ray images, while 21 (37%) studies used CT images for the training of GANs. For the majority of the studies (n=47, 82%), the experiments were conducted and results were reported using publicly available data. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was reported by only 2 (4%) studies. Conclusions: Studies have shown that GANs have great potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lung images in COVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs' performance through the superresolution of the images and segmentation. This review also identified key limitations of the potential transformation of GAN-based methods in clinical applications.},

In particular, promoting youth engagement not only enhances crisis awareness and resilience among the young generation, but also has a positive impact on youths' social participation and responsibility. With the increasing popularity of online video services, leveraging online videos to disseminate authoritative information has become a method widely adopted by government. To enhance youth awareness and engagement, two new video-based crisis communication strategies have been utilized on a popular youth-targeted video platform Bilibili in China: creating recreational videos such as animation and music videos, and collaborating with individual video-uploaders in video making. However, their impacts and results are largely unknown, which motivates our study. Guided by Entertainment Education (EE) and Collaborative Governance (CG), we report, to our best knowledge, the first systematic study on how recreational video category and government-citizen collaboration would influence youth engagement focusing on 3347 COVID-19-related government-generated videos on Bilibili. This study reveals that recreational videos successfully promote youth engagement including interaction, feedback and sharing. Collaboration with individual uploaders in video making also has a substantially positive impact on youth engagement. Through an in-depth qualitative content analysis of user-generated commentaries, we further unpacked the unique values (e.g., trust work for youth participation) as well as latent limitations (e.g., imbalanced topic distribution) of the two new strategies. We discuss how the findings enrich EE and CG theoretically, and provide practical implications to effective and engaging communication strategies during crises.},

   abstract = {Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented; under resource-constrained settings, predictive algorithms can help to stratify disease severity, alerting physicians of high-risk patients; however, there are only few risk scores derived from a substantially large electronic health record (EHR) data set, using simplified predictors as input. Objective: The objectives of this study were to develop and validate simplified machine learning algorithms that predict COVID-19 adverse outcomes; to evaluate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and calibration of the algorithms; and to derive clinically meaningful thresholds. Methods: We performed machine learning model development and validation via a cohort study using multicenter, patient-level, longitudinal EHRs from the Optum COVID-19 database that provides anonymized, longitudinal EHR from across the United States. The models were developed based on clinical characteristics to predict 28-day in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respiratory failure, and mechanical ventilator usages at inpatient setting. Data from patients who were admitted from February 1, 2020, to September 7, 2020, were randomly sampled into development, validation, and test data sets; data collected from September 7, 2020, to November 15, 2020, were reserved as the postdevelopment prospective test data set. Results: Of the 3.7 million patients in the analysis, 585,867 patients were diagnosed or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 50,703 adult patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 between February 1 and November 15, 2020. Among the study cohort (n=50,703), there were 6204 deaths, 9564 ICU admissions, 6478 mechanically ventilated or EMCO patients, and 25,169 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or respiratory failure within 28 days since hospital admission. The algorithms demonstrated high accuracy (AUC 0.89, 95% CI 0.89-0.89 on the test data set [n=10,752]), consistent prediction through the second wave of the pandemic from September to November (AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.85-0.86) on the postdevelopment prospective test data set [n=14,863], great clinical relevance, and utility. Besides, a comprehensive set of 386 input covariates from baseline or at admission were included in the analysis; the end-to-end pipeline automates feature selection and model development. The parsimonious model with only 10 input predictors produced comparably accurate predictions; these 10 predictors (age, blood urea nitrogen, SpO2, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiration rate, pulse, temperature, albumin, and major cognitive disorder excluding stroke) are commonly measured and concordant with recognized risk factors for COVID-19. Conclusions: The systematic approach and rigorous validation demonstrate consistent model performance to predict even beyond the period of data collection, with satisfactory discriminatory power and great clinical utility. Overall, the study offers an accurate, validated, and reliable prediction model based on only 10 clinical features as a prognostic tool to stratifying patients with COVID-19 into intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk groups. This simple predictive tool is shared with a wider health care community, to enable service as an early warning system to alert physicians of possible high-risk patients, or as a resource triaging tool to optimize health care resources.},

   abstract = {Stress has a significant impact on the physical and mental health of an individual and is a growing concern for society, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Facial video-based stress evaluation from non-invasive cameras has proven to be a significantly more efficient method to evaluate stress in comparison to approaches that use questionnaires or wearable sensors. Plenty of classification models have been built for stress detection. However, most do not consider individual differences. Also, the results for such models are limited by a uni-dimensional definition of stress levels lacking a comprehensive quantitative definition of stress.The dissertation focuses on building a framework that utilizes the multilevel video frame representations from deep learning and the remote photoplethysmography signals extracted from the facial videos for stress assessment. The fusion model takes the inputs of a baseline video and a target video of the subject. The physiological features such as heart rate and heart rate variability are used with the initial stress scores generated from deep learning are used to predict the stress scores in cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self-confidence.To generate stress scores with better accuracy, the signal extraction method is improved by introducing the CWT-SNR method that uses the signal-to-noise ratio to assist the adaptive bandpass filtering in the post-processing of the signals. A study on phase space reconstruction features is performed and the results show the potential for additional accuracy improvement for the heart rate variability detection. To select the best deep learning architecture, multiple deep learning architectures are tested to build the deep learning model. Support Vector Regression is used to generate the output stress score results. Testing with the data from the UBFC-Phys dataset, the fusion model shows a strong correlation between ground truth and the predicted results.},

Family Dispute Resolution (FDR) services continued to assist separating couples to sort out their parenting and property matters, necessitating a rapid and wholesale shift to remote delivery via telephone and video conferencing. This paper reports on interviews during and subsequent to ‘lockdown’ with clients of FDR services offered by a large, community-sector provider. The data collected provide insights into the ways in which the pandemic affected the immediate needs and concerns of families as they navigated separation and shared parenting during the pandemic. Of importance to service development, the data include client responses to different methods of FDR service delivery and their reflections on how well these evolving methods were suited to their needs. Practitioner views were also sought on service delivery methods to provide a comprehensive picture of the advantages and challenges of remote delivery, and the ways in which it helped or hindered in catering to the needs of clients with safety concerns. Collectively the results of these analyses indicate that COVID has produced new risks and opportunities for the provision of FDR services, in both COVID and post-COVID worlds. The evolving FDR service model will likely continue to feature multiple delivery options, regardless of the trajectory of the pandemic.},

   abstract = {Occupants’ behavior is a major source of uncertainty for the optimal operation of building energy systems. The highly stochastic hot water use behavior of occupants has led to conservative operational strategies for hot water systems, that try to ensure occupants’ comfort by following energy-intensive operational approaches. Intending to integrate the occupants’ behavior into hot water systems control, this study proposes a control framework based on Reinforcement Learning, which can learn the stochastic occupants' behavior and make a balance between opposing objectives of water hygiene, comfort, and energy use. A model-free approach is implemented to ensure transferability. To achieve fast convergence on the target house while being model-free, this study proposes an offline training procedure integrating a stochastic hot water use model to mimic the hot water use behavior of occupants. The proposed framework is then evaluated using an actual hot water use and weather dataset collected over 29 weeks from a residential house in Switzerland. The performance of the proposed control framework is compared to the conventional rule-based controller as the common practice in hot water systems. While the hot water use dataset has been collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an abnormal schedule of occupants, results indicate that the proposed control framework could successfully learn and adapt to the occupants' behavior and achieve 23.8% of energy saving, while maintaining the occupants' comfort and water hygiene. The adaptive nature of the proposed control framework shows significant potential in reducing the discrepancy between supply and demand in hot water systems.},

   abstract = {When it comes to residential buildings, there are several stochastic parameters, such as renewable energy production, outdoor air conditions, and occupants’ behavior, that are hard to model and predict accurately, with some being unique in each specific building. This increases the complexity of developing a generalizable optimal control method that can be transferred to different buildings. Rather than hard-programming human knowledge into the controller (in terms of rules or models), a learning ability can be provided to the controller such that over the time it can learn by itself how to maintain an optimal operation in each specific building. This research proposes a model-free control framework based on Reinforcement Learning that takes into account the stochastic hot water use behavior of occupants, solar power generation, and weather conditions, and learns how to make a balance between the energy use, occupant comfort and water hygiene in a solar-assisted space heating and hot water production system. A stochastic-based offline training procedure is proposed to give a prior experience to the agent in a safe simulation environment, and further ensure occupants comfort and health when the algorithm starts online learning on the real house. To make a realistic assessment without interrupting the occupants, weather conditions and hot water use behavior are experimentally monitored in three case studies in different regions of Switzerland, and the collected data are used in simulations to evaluate the proposed control framework against two rule-based methods. Results indicate that the proposed framework could achieve an energy saving from 7% to 60%, mainly by adapting to solar power generation, without violating comfort or compromising the health of occupants.},

   abstract = {With the global spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, a reliable method is required for identifying COVID-19 victims. The biggest issue in detecting the virus is a lack of testing kits that are both reliable and affordable. Due to the virus's rapid dissemination, medical professionals have trouble finding positive patients. However, the next real-life issue is sharing data with hospitals around the world while considering the organizations' privacy concerns. The primary worries for training a global Deep Learning (DL) model are creating a collaborative platform and personal confidentiality. Another challenge is exchanging data with health care institutions while protecting the organizations' confidentiality. The primary concerns for training a universal DL model are creating a collaborative platform and preserving privacy. This paper provides a model that receives a small quantity of data from various sources, like organizations or sections of hospitals, and trains a global DL model utilizing blockchain-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In addition, we use the Transfer Learning (TL) technique to initialize layers rather than initialize randomly and discover which layers should be removed before selection. Besides, the blockchain system verifies the data, and the DL method trains the model globally while keeping the institution's confidentiality. Furthermore, we gather the actual and novel COVID-19 patients. Finally, we run extensive experiments utilizing Python and its libraries, such as Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, to assess the proposed method. We evaluated works using five different datasets, including Boukan Dr. Shahid Gholipour hospital, Tabriz Emam Reza hospital, Mahabad Emam Khomeini hospital, Maragheh Dr.Beheshti hospital, and Miandoab Abbasi hospital datasets, and our technique outperform state-of-the-art methods on average in terms of precision (2.7%), recall (3.1%), F1 (2.9%), and accuracy (2.8%).},

Based on this conceptualization, we develop a cyclical model of organizational resilience that incorporates its heterogeneity and thus allows for more nuanced and precise applications to a variety of contexts and forms of adversity.},

According to the United Nations Population Fund, cities accommodated 3.3 billion people (54%) of the global population in 2014. By 2050, around 5 billion people (68%) will be residing in cities. In order to make lifestyles in cities more comfortable and cost-effective, the city must be smart and intelligent. It is mainly accomplished through an intelligent decision-making process using computational intelligence-based technologies. This paper explored how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in the smart city concept. From 2014 to 2021, we examined 133 articles (97% of Scopus and 73% of WoS) in healthcare, education, environment and waste management, agriculture, mobility and smart transportation, risk management, and security. Moreover, we observed that the healthcare (23% impact), mobility (19% impact), privacy and security (11% impact), and energy sectors (10% impact) have a more significant influence on AI adoption in smart cities. Since the epidemic hit cities in 2019, the healthcare industry has intensified its AI-based advances by 60%. According to the analysis, AI algorithms such as ANN, RNN/LSTM, CNN/R-CNN, DNN, and SVM/LS-SVM have a higher impact on the various smart city domains.},

   abstract = {<p>Controlling the spreading of infectious diseases has been shown crucial in the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional contact tracing is used to detect newly infected individuals by tracing their previous contacts, and by selectively checking and isolating any individuals likely to have been infected. Digital contact tracing with the utilisation of smartphones was contrived as a technological aid to improve this manual, slow and tedious process. Nevertheless, despite the high hopes raised when smartphone-based contact tracing apps were introduced as a measure to reduce the spread of the COVID-19, their efficiency has been moderately low. In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating digital contact tracing apps, based on an epidemic model, which will be used not only to evaluate the deployed Apps against the COVID-19 but also to determine how they can be improved for future pandemics. Firstly, the model confirms the moderate effectiveness of the deployed digital contact tracing, confirming the fact that it could not be used as the unique measure to fight against the COVID-19, and had to be combined with additional measures. Secondly, several improvements are proposed (and evaluated) to increase the efficiency of digital control tracing to become a more useful tool in the future.</p>},

For this research, a data set of 10,454 patients from 14 hospitals in Galicia (Spain) was used. Each patient is characterized by 833 variables, two of which are age and gender and the other are records of diseases or conditions in their medical history. In addition, for each patient, his/her history of hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) admissions due to CoVid-19 is available. This clinical history will serve to label each patient and thus being able to assess the predictions of the model. Our aim is to identify which model delivers the best accuracies for both hospital and ICU admissions only using demographic variables and some structured clinical data, as well as identifying which of those are more relevant in both cases. The results obtained in the experimental study show that the best models are those based on oversampling as a preprocessing phase to balance the distribution of classes. Using these models and all the available features, we achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 76.1% and 80.4% for predicting the need of hospital and ICU admissions, respectively. Furthermore, feature selection and oversampling techniques were applied and it has been experimentally verified that the relevant variables for the classification are age and gender, since only using these two features the performance of the models is not degraded for the two mentioned prediction problems.},

   abstract = {The modern world holds countless risks for humanity, both large-scale and intimately personal—from cyberwarfare, pandemics, and climate change to sexually transmitted diseases and drug use and abuse. Many risks have prompted institutional, regulatory, and technological countermeasures, the success of which depends to some extent on how individuals learn about the risks in question. We distinguish between two powerful but imperfect teachers of risk. First, people may learn by consulting symbolic and descriptive material, such as warnings, statistics, and images. More often than not, however, a risk’s fluidity defies precise description. Second, people may learn about risks through personal experience. Responses to risk can differ systematically depending on whether people learn through one mode, both, or neither. One reason for these differences—and by no means the only reason—is the discrepancy in the cognitive impact that rare events (typically the risk event) and common events (typically the nonoccurrence of the risk event) have on the decision maker. We propose a description–experience framework that highlights not only the impact of each mode of learning but also the effects of their interplay on individuals’ and collectives’ responses to risk. We outline numerous research questions and themes suggested by this framework.},

These risks are part of a special category of intersystemic systemic risks, which are ‘compound’ in nature: they possess the potential to cascade across different systems and entail a liability to exponential growth across numbers of linked systems. Moreover, climate change and zoonotic disease risks are globalised, ubiquitous and entrenched. Effective governance of intersystemic systemic risks demands proactive regulatory intervention at the early stages of risk creation, and reliance on a more balanced basket of regulatory measures than is currently available. For climate change as well as zoonotic disease risk control, this calls for greater investment in assessment requirements, a less permissive approach to planning and development consent, and a commitment to phase out unsustainable production processes.},

   abstract = {Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide, and the outbreak of the disease was designated a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Such outbreaks would certainly be catastrophic for some of the best-ranked health systems and would be more catastrophic in countries with more fragile health systems. Accordingly, the World Health Organization and other organizations have been appealing to donor countries to support a rapid response plan. The primary objectives of this response plan are to appeal for funds from donors and to distribute these funds to the most affected countries based on the requirements. Methods: In this study, we developed a mathematical model to provide initial insights into the efficient and equitable distribution of urgent funds to high-priority countries. Three phases were proposed for the construction of this mathematical model. In the first phase, the final epidemic sizes in all the target countries were predicted by using three epidemiological models. In the second phase, the urgent requirements for each country were estimated in parallel with the estimates issued by the humanitarian response plan, based on the size of the epidemic and several other factors. In the third and final phase, a multi-objective optimization model was proposed. The first objective was to maximize the funds from donors to cover all the requirements. The second objective was to minimize the unmet demands by ensuring a fair distribution of the urgent funds based on the requirements of the target countries. Results: Predictions of the basic reproduction numbers and the final epidemic sizes were calculated for all target countries. The urgent requirements were estimated, and the requirements issued by the humanitarian response plan for all target countries were also considered. Moreover, a proposed response plan for the distribution network was demonstrated. Donors must provide urgent funds exceeding US$ 2,608,084,209 to cover at least 40 % of each target country's requirements. Overall, results demonstrate the importance of an urgent and fair distribution of funds to the target countries to overcome the outbreak of COVID-19. Conclusions: Rapid responses by donor countries to humanitarian appeals will facilitate the immediate and fair distribution of relief supplies to the poorest countries. This distribution may help to support health systems, restrain the spread of COVID-19, and prevent an unlimited catastrophe.},

In the contemporary smart care scenario, homes are fitted with an array of sensors for remote monitoring providing data that feed into intelligent systems developed to highlight concerning patterns of behaviour or physiological measurements and to alert healthcare professionals to the need for action. This paper explores some ethical issues that may arise within such smart care systems, focusing on the extent to which ethical issues can be addressed at the system design stage. Artificial intelligence has been widely portrayed as an ethically risky technology, posing challenges for privacy and human autonomy and with the potential to introduce and exacerbate bias and inequality. While broad principles for ethical artificial intelligence have become established, the mechanisms for governing ethical artificial intelligence are still evolving. In healthcare settings the implementation of smart technologies falls within the existing frameworks for ethical review and governance. Feeding into this ethical review there are many practical steps that designers can take to build ethical considerations into the technology. After exploring the pre-emptive steps that can be taken in design and governance to provide for an ethical smart care system, the paper reviews the potential for further ethical challenges to arise within the everyday implementation of smart care systems in the context of dementia, despite the best efforts of all concerned to pre-empt them. The paper concludes with an exploration of the dilemmas that may thus face healthcare professionals involved in implementing this kind of smart care and with a call for further research to explore ethical dimensions of smart care both in terms of general principles and lived experience.</p>},

   abstract = {Background: In the summer of 2021, the Olympic Games were held in Tokyo during the state of emergency due to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. New daily positive cases (DPC) increased before the Olympic Games, and then decreased a few weeks after the Games. However, several cofactors influencing DPC exist; consequently, careful consideration is needed for future international events during an epidemic. Methods: The impact of the Olympic Games on new DPC were evaluated in the Tokyo, Osaka, and Aichi Prefectures using a well-trained and -evaluated long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In addition, we proposed a compensation method based on effective reproduction number (ERN) to assess the effect of the national holidays on the DPC. Results: During the spread phase, the estimated DPC with LSTM was 30%–60% lower than that of the observed value, but was consistent with the compensated value of the ERN for the three prefectures. During the decay phase, the estimated DPC was consistent with the observed values. The timing of the decay coincided with achievement of a fully-vaccinated rate of 10%–15% of people aged <65 years. Conclusions: The up- and downsurge of the pandemic wave observed in July and September are likely attributable to high ERN during national holiday periods and to the vaccination effect, especially for people aged <65 years. The effect of national holidays in Tokyo was rather notable in Aichi and Osaka, which are distant from Tokyo. The effect of the Olympic Games on the spread and decay of the pandemic wave is neither dominant nor negligible due to the shifting of the national holiday dates to coincide with the Olympic Games.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a succinct review of attempts in the literature to use game theory to model decision-making scenarios relevant to defence applications. Game theory has been proven as a very effective tool in modelling the decision-making processes of intelligent agents, entities, and players. It has been used to model scenarios from diverse fields such as economics, evolutionary biology, and computer science. In defence applications, there is often a need to model and predict the actions of hostile actors, and players who try to evade or out-smart each other. Modelling how the actions of competitive players shape the decision making of each other is the forte of game theory. In past decades, there have been several studies that applied different branches of game theory to model a range of defence-related scenarios. This paper provides a structured review of such attempts, and classifies existing literature in terms of the kind of warfare modelled, the types of games used, and the players involved. After careful selection, a total of 29 directly relevant papers are discussed and classified. In terms of the warfares modelled, we recognise that most papers that apply game theory in defence settings are concerned with Command and Control Warfare, and can be further classified into papers dealing with (i) Resource Allocation Warfare (ii) Information Warfare (iii) Weapons Control Warfare, and (iv) Adversary Monitoring Warfare. We also observe that most of the reviewed papers are concerned with sensing, tracking, and large sensor networks, and the studied problems have parallels in sensor network analysis in the civilian domain. In terms of the games used, we classify the reviewed papers into papers that use non-cooperative or cooperative games, simultaneous or sequential games, discrete or continuous games, and non-zero-sum or zero-sum games. Similarly, papers are also classified into two-player, three-player or multi-player game based papers. We also explore the nature of players and the construction of payoff functions in each scenario. Finally, we also identify gaps in literature where game theory could be fruitfully applied in scenarios hitherto unexplored using game theory. The presented analysis provides a concise summary of the state-of-the-art with regards to the use of game theory in defence applications and highlights the benefits and limitations of game theory in the considered scenarios.},

   abstract = {Coronavirus (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented global crisis because of its detrimental effect on the global economy and health. COVID-19 cases have been rapidly increasing, with no sign of stopping. As a result, test kits and accurate detection models are in short supply. Early identification of COVID-19 patients will help decrease the infection rate. Thus, developing an automatic algorithm that enables the early detection of COVID-19 is essential. Moreover, patient data are sensitive, and they must be protected to prevent malicious attackers from revealing information through model updates and reconstruction. In this study, we presented a higher privacy-preserving federated learning system for COVID-19 detection without sharing data among data owners. First, we constructed a federated learning system using chest X-ray images and symptom information. The purpose is to develop a decentralized model across multiple hospitals without sharing data. We found that adding the spatial pyramid pooling to a 2D convolutional neural network improves the accuracy of chest X-ray images. Second, we explored that the accuracy of federated learning for COVID-19 identification reduces significantly for non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. We then proposed a strategy to improve the model’s accuracy on Non-IID data by increasing the total number of clients, parallelism (client-fraction), and computation per client. Finally, for our federated learning model, we applied a differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) to improve the privacy of patient data. We also proposed a strategy to maintain the robustness of federated learning to ensure the security and accuracy of the model.},

   abstract = {Despite a rapidly changing labor market, little is known about how youth’s career goals correspond to projections about the future of work. This research examined the career aspirations of 3,367 adolescents (age 13–18 years) from 42 U.S. states. We conducted a large-scale coding effort using the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) to compile the vocational interests, educational requirements, and automation risk levels of career aspirations. Results revealed that most adolescents aspired to careers with low potential for automation. However, there were large discrepancies between the sample’s aspirations and the types of jobs available when the sample entered the workforce. Almost 50% of adolescents aspired to either an investigative or artistic career, which together account for only 8% of the U.S. labor market. There were also notable trends across age and gender, such that aspirations were more gendered among younger adolescents, whereas older adolescents appeared less influenced by gender stereotypes. Overall, findings indicate important discrepancies between young people’s dream jobs and employment realities. We discuss how lofty career aspirations can have both positive and negative effects, and we present implications for career theories and workforce development initiatives aimed at promoting a more dynamic future workforce.},

Such measures are currently either implemented or at least discussed in numerous countries worldwide to ward off a potential new wave of COVID-19. They come in the form of Health Passes (HP), which grant full access to public life only to individuals with a certificate that proves that they have either been fully vaccinated, have recovered from a previous infection or have recently tested negative to SARS-Cov-2. We develop both a compartmental model as well as an epidemic Renormalisation Group approach, which is capable of describing the dynamics over a longer period of time, notably an entire epidemiological wave. Introducing different versions of HPs in this model, we are capable of providing quantitative estimates on the effectiveness of the underlying measures as a function of the fraction of the population that is vaccinated and the vaccination rate. We apply our models to the latest COVID-19 wave in several European countries, notably Germany and Austria, which validate our theoretical findings.},

   abstract = {One of the primary limitations of deep learning is data-hungry techniques. Deep learning approaches do not typically generalize well for limited datasets with fewer samples. Drawing the inspiration from the way human beings are capable of detecting a face from very few images seen in past (experience), Few-Shot Learning methods are reported in the literature. The problem is more challenging for face recognition tasks for limited dataset where the facial images are captured in various unfavorable conditions (i.e. discrepancies). To that end, in this work, we propose the Siamese Network-based Few-Shot Learning method for multi-class face recognition from a training dataset consisting of only a handful of images per class. We consider three such face image discrepancies namely, low light, head rotation and occlusion. Our work offers novelty primarily in the way the image discrepancies are overcome via Few-Shot learning while recognizing the face with reasonable accuracy. The results are obtained on our manually collected primary dataset (SCAAI_FSL) for multiple classes. Our approach presents a unique solution for face recognition tasks where the images in the training and testing dataset have different discrepancies which is the typical real-world scenario. We have experimented with various face embeddings models and demonstrated our approach for simultaneously handling multiple image discrepancies for SCAAI_FSL dataset and reported the testing accuracy of 72.72%.},

In the current laboratory experiment, a total of N = 101 participants played four chapters of Detroit: Become Human for approx. 55 min. A maximum of 13 moral decisions had to be made either under time pressure or not. Before playing, participants were assigned to one of three conditions (i.e., playing morally vs. immorally framed character vs. no framing/control condition). As expected, players generally preferred to act morally regardless of character framing. Time pressure further increased the proportion of moral (vs. immoral) decision-making. Our results underline that moral decision-making is dependent on specific contexts and that morality theories can be applied to virtual gaming scenarios.},

Hence, a multidimensional approach based on perceptual attributes and psychoacoustic parameters is proposed. In-situ audio-visual recordings of 16 construction machinery in operation were evaluated subjectively on both perceived annoyance and a 12-item semantic differential perceptual attribute scale. The 16 machinery noises formed three clusters based on four perceptual components (Incisiveness, Strength, Intermittency, and Periodicity) derived via principal component analysis of the perceptual attributes. Notably, individual perceptual components strongly correlate with mean values of psychoacoustic parameters (loudness, sharpness, roughness, and fluctuation strength) over time, which we use to develop an annoyance model for construction noise. Both loudness and fluctuation strength were critical parameters to discriminate between clusters. The model can be used to automatically categorize construction noises by cluster and manage it based on known cluster characteristics.},

If used appropriately, the rapidly expanding wealth of health data could improve healthcare research, delivery of care, and patient outcomes. However, this depends on two key factors: (1) building structures that increase the confidence and willingness of European Union (EU) citizens to permit the collection and use of their data, and (2) development of EU health policy to support and shape data collection infrastructures, methodologies, transmission, and use. The great potential for use of RWE in healthcare improvement merits careful exploration of the drivers of, and challenges preventing, efficient RWD curation. Literature-based research was performed to identify relevant themes and discussion topics for two sets of expert panels, organized by the European Alliance for Personalised Medicine. These expert panels discussed steps that would enable a gradual but steady growth in the quantity, quality, and beneficial deployment of RWE. Participants were selected to provide insight based on their professional medical, economic, patient, industry, or governmental experience.

Due to the rapid worldwide spread of this highly contagious disease, making its early detection with high accuracy important for breaking the chain of transition. X-ray images of COVID-19 patients, reveal specific abnormalities associated with this disease. Methods: In this study, a multi-view feature learning method for detecting COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images is presented. This method provides a framework for exploiting the multiple types of deep features, which is able to preserve both the correlative and the complementary information, and achieve accurate detection at the classification phase. Deep features are extracted using pre-trained deep CNN models of AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and VGG19. The learned feature representation of X-ray images are then classified using ELM. Results: The experiments show that our method achieves accuracy scores of 100%, 99.82%, and 99.82% in detecting three classes of COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia, respectively. The sensitivities of three classes are 100%, 100%, and 99.45%, respectively. The specificities of three classes are 100%, 99.73%, and 100%, respectively. The precision values of three classes are 100%, 99.45%, and 100%, respectively. The F-scores of three classes are 100%, 99.73%, and 99.72%, respectively. The overall accuracy score of our method is 99.82%. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting COVID-19 cases and can therefore assist experts in early diagnosis based on X-ray images.},

   abstract = {Moving object detection (MOD) is the process of extracting dynamic foreground content from the video frames, such as moving vehicles or pedestrians, while discarding the non-moving background. It plays an essential role in computer vision field. The traditional methods meet difficulties when applied in complex scenarios, such as videos with illumination changes, shadows, night scenes, and dynamic backgrounds. Deep learning methods have been actively applied to moving object detection in recent years and demonstrated impressive results. However, many existing models render superior detection accuracy at the cost of high computational complexity and slow inference speed. This fact has hindered the development of such models in mobile and embedded vision tasks, which need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computationally limited platform.The current research aims to use the technique of separable convolution in both 2D and 3D CNN together with our proposed multi-input multi-output strategy and two-branch structure to devise new deep network models that significantly improve inference speed, yet require smaller model size and achieve reduction in floating-point operations as compared to existing deep learning models with competitive detection accuracy.This research devised three deep neural network models, addressing the following main problems in the area of moving object detection:1. Improving Detection Accuracy by extracting both spatial and temporal information: To improve detection accuracy, the proposed models adopt 3D convolution which is more suitable to extract both spatial and temporal information in video data than 2D convolution. We also put this 3D convolution into two-branch network that extracts both high-level global features and low-level detailed features can further increase the accuracy.2. Reduce model size and computational complexity by changing network structure: The standard 2D and 3D convolution are further decomposed into depth-wise and pointwise convolutions. While existing 3D separable CNN all addressed other problems such as gesture recognition, force prediction, 3D object classification or reconstruction, our work applied it to the moving object detection task for the first time in the literature.3. Increasing inference speed by changing the input-output relationship: We proposed a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strategy to increase inference speed, which can take multiple frames as the network input and output multiple frames of detection results. This MIMO embedded in 3Dseparable CNN can further increase model inference speed significantly and maintain high detection accuracy.Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed methods significantly increases the inference speed, reduces the model size, meanwhile achieving the highest detection accuracy in the scene dependent evaluation (SDE) setup and maintaining a competitive detection accuracy in the scene independent evaluation (SIE) setup. The SDE setup is widely used to tune and test the model on a specific video as the training and test sets are from the same video. The SIE setup is designed to assess the generalization capability of the model on completely unseen videos.},

In the 5G era, network services are not limited to mobile phones and computers but support the normal operation of equipment in all walks of life. There are more and more scenarios and more and more complex scenarios, and more convenient and fast methods are needed to assist network services. In order to better perform network offloading of the business, make the business more refined, and assist the better development of 5G network technology, this article proposes 5G network slicing: methods to support blockchain and reinforcement learning, aiming to improve the efficiency of network services. The research results of the article show the following: (1) In the model testing stage, the research results on the variation of the delay with the number of slices show that the delay increases with the increase of the number of slices, but the blockchain + reinforcement learning method has the lowest delay. The minimum delay can be maintained. When the number of slices is 3, the delay is 155 ms. (2) The comparison of the latency of different types of slices shows that the latency of 5G network slicing is lower than that of 4G, 3G, and 2G network slicing, and the minimum latency of 5G network slicing using blockchain and reinforcement learning is only 15 ms. (3) In the detection of system reliability, reliability decreases as the number of users increases because reliability is related to time delay. The greater the transmission delay, the lower the reliability. The reliability of supporting blockchain + reinforcement learning method is the highest, with a reliability of 0.95. (4) Through the resource utilization experiment of different slices, it can be known that the method of blockchain + reinforcement learning has the highest resource utilization. The resource utilization rate of the four slices under the blockchain + reinforcement learning method is all above 0.8 and the highest is 1. (5) Through the simulation test of the experiment, the results show that the average receiving throughput of video stream 1 is higher than that of video stream 2, IOT devices and mobile devices, and the average cumulative receiving throughput under the blockchain + reinforcement learning method. The highest is 1450 kbps. The average QOE of video stream 1 is higher than that of video stream 2, IOT devices and mobile devices, and the average QOE is the highest under the blockchain + reinforcement learning method, reaching 0.83.},

For the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction remains the gold standard. Currently available lab tests may not be able to detect all infected individuals; new screening methods are required.

Furthermore, we use an explainability method to investigate several Convolutional Networks COVID-Net forecasts in an effort to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID-19 instances, but also to aid clinicians in improving screening. We show that using transfer learning and pre-trained models, we can detect it with a high degree of accuracy. Using X-ray images, we chose four neural networks to predict its probability.

We developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based pipeline to understand public perceptions of and stances on COVID-19-related drugs on Twitter across time. METHODS This retrospective study included 609,189 US-based tweets between January 29th, 2020 and November 30th, 2021 on four drugs that gained wide public attention during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, drug therapies with anecdotal evidence; and 2) Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, FDA-approved treatment options for eligible patients. Time-trend analysis was used to understand the popularity and related events. Content and demographic analyses were conducted to explore potential rationales of people's stances on each drug. RESULTS Time-trend analysis revealed that Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin received much more discussion than Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, particularly during COVID-19 surges. Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin were highly politicized, related to conspiracy theories, hearsay, celebrity effects, etc. The distribution of stance between the two major US political parties was significantly different (p < 0.001); Republicans were much more likely to support Hydroxychloroquine (+55%) and Ivermectin (+30%) than Democrats. People with healthcare backgrounds tended to oppose Hydroxychloroquine (+7%) more than the general population; in contrast, the general population was more likely to support Ivermectin (+14%). CONCLUSION Our study found that social media users with have different perceptions and stances on off-label versus FDA-authorized drug use across different stages of COVID-19, indicating that health systems, regulatory agencies, and policymakers should design "targeted" strategies to monitor and reduce misinformation for promoting safe drug use.

   abstract = {Background: Internet-based online virtual health services were originally an important way for the Chinese government to resolve unmet medical service needs due to inadequate medical institutions. Its initial development was not well received. Then, the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic produced a tremendous demand for telehealth in a short time, which stimulated the explosive development of internet hospitals. The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (SAHZU) has taken a leading role in the construction of internet hospitals in China. The pandemic triggered the hospital to develop unique research on health service capacity under strict quarantine policies and to predict long-term trends. Objective: This study aims to provide policy enlightenment for the construction of internet-based health services to better fight against COVID-19 and to elucidate future directions through an in-depth analysis of 2 years of online health service data gleaned from SAHZU's experiences and lessons learned. Methods: We collected data from SAHZU Internet Hospital from November 1, 2019, to September 16, 2021. Data from over 900,000 users were analyzed with respect to demographic characteristics, demands placed on departments by user needs, new registrations, and consultation behaviors. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was adopted to evaluate the impact of this momentous emergency event and its long-term trends. With theme analysis and a defined 2D model, 3 investigations were conducted synchronously to determine users' authentic demands on online hospitals. Results: The general profile of internet hospital users is young or middle-aged women who live in Zhejiang and surrounding provinces. The ITS model indicated that, after the intervention (the strict quarantine policies) was implemented during the outbreak, the number of internet hospital users significantly increased (β_2=105.736, P<.001). Further, long-term waves of COVID-19 led to an increasing number of users following the outbreak (β_3=0.167, P<.001). In theme analysis, we summarized 8 major demands by users of the SAHZU internet hospital during the national shutdown period and afterwards. Online consultations and information services were persistent and universal demands, followed by concerns about medical safety and quality, time, and cost. Users' medical behavior patterns changed from onsite to online as internet hospital demands increased. Conclusions: The pandemic has spawned the explosive growth of telehealth; as a public tertiary internet hospital, the SAHZU internet hospital is partially and irreversibly integrated into the traditional medical system. As we shared the practical examples of 1 public internet hospital in China, we put forward suggestions about the future direction of telehealth. Vital experience in the construction of internet hospitals was provided in the normalization of COVID-19 prevention and control, which can be demonstrated as a model of internet hospital management practice for other medical institutions.},

   abstract = {This article argues for the construction of a new political economy based on Chinese practices. It begins with an explanation of the research approach of starting from practice, and from a distinctive mode of thinking that is akin to that of medicine, rather than Newtonian physics and mathematical logic. Then it discusses the present-day Chinese practices of combining socialism with market economy, state enterprises with private enterprises, the peasant economy with an industrial economy, and the party-state with the economy—all distinctive realities about the new Chinese political-economic system. The foil for the discussion is the long-standing hegemonic ideology and worldview of Anglo-American classical and neoclassical liberal economics and law. This article suggests that we employ China’s traditional dyadic integration worldview, evident in today’s practices, to arrive at a new integrative cosmological view that rises above both. To a considerable extent, this article is also a reinterpretation of classical Marxist political economy. What the article advocates may be termed a “participatory socialist market economy,” to be distinguished from a bureaucratized and controlling socialist planned economy. This is a system that is still very much in the process of formation, its particular content and characteristics yet to be clarified and specified through a sustained period of searching through practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic and high-risk COVID-19 patients are advised to self-isolate at home. However, patients may not realize that the condition is deteriorating until too late. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review various artificial intelligence-based telemedicine research during the COVID-19 outbreak and proposes a framework for developing telemedicine powered by artificial intelligence to monitor progression in COVID-19 patients during isolation at home. It also aims to map challenges using artificial intelligence-based telemedicine in the community. METHODS: A systematic review was performed for the related articles published in 2019-2021 and conducted in the PubMed and ScienceDirect database using the keywords "telemedicine," "artificial intelligence," and "COVID-19". The inclusion criteria were full-text articles and original research written in the English language. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were included in this review to describe the current application of artificial intelligence-based telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Various current applications have been implemented, such as for early diagnosis and tracing of contact for the users, to monitor symptoms and decision-making treatment, clinical management, and virtual and remote treatment. We also proposed the framework of telemedicine powered by artificial intelligence for support the self-isolation of COVID-19 patients based on the recent update in technology. However, we identified some challenges for using digital health technologies because of the ethical and practical use, the policy and regulation, and device use both for healthcare workers and patients. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence promises to improve the practice of medicine in various ways. However, practical applications still need to be explored, and medical professionals also need to adapt to these advances for better healthcare delivery to the public.},

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a sharp increase in hospitalized patients with multi-organ disease pneumonia. Early and automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to slow down the spread of this epidemic and reduce the mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we propose a joint multi-center sparse learning (MCSL) and decision fusion scheme exploiting chest CT images for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis. Specifically, considering the inconsistency of data in multiple centers, we first convert CT images into histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) images to reduce the structural differences between multi-center data and enhance the generalization performance. We then exploit a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) model to learn the useful information between and within 3D HOG image slices and extract multi-center features. Furthermore, we employ the proposed MCSL method that learns the intrinsic structure between multiple centers and within each center, which selects discriminative features to jointly train multi-center classifiers. Finally, we fuse these decisions made by these classifiers. Extensive experiments are performed on chest CT images from five centers to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve COVID-19 diagnosis performance and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.},

A sequence of reference probability measure changes is employed to obtain a compact and implementable price representations. We demonstrate how a change of numéraire approach facilitates the valuation of a GMAB rider in a variable annuity. A numerical illustration is presented to confirm the computational efficiency and accuracy of our proposed valuation methodology. In particular, our proposed approach on average takes only 0.07% of the computing time for the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation technique to complete the valuation calculation. Furthermore, the standard errors of our approach's results are lower than those obtained from the MC-based computations. A sensitivity analysis is also performed with respect to various parameters. When there are no renewal options in a GMAB contract, we get the special case of a guaranteed minimum maturity benefit for which a closed-form valuation solution is established.},

To examine these potential changes, this article draws on findings from data gathered through interviews, surveys and secondary data over two time periods: prior to the pandemic and during the fallout from the pandemic. The article utilises the concept of ‘entrepreneurial ecosystems’ and the analysis finds significant adaptability and resilience across the ecosystems addressed. It is argued that these ecosystems are not only likely to survive, but also to actually thrive as the requirement for new technological solutions and applications allows them to maintain their innovative capacity and capability. It is further found that more spatially distributed patterns of entrepreneurial innovation are emerging across a wider range of cities and regions, which is leading to changes in the spatial economics of innovation. It is concluded that the pandemic is likely to heighten rather than slow down these trends. Furthermore, these trends are set to continue until any new unforeseen global shock with the capacity to destabilise such patterns occurs.</p>},

   abstract = {Background: With the continuous spread of COVID-19, information about the worldwide pandemic is exploding. Therefore, it is necessary and significant to organize such a large amount of information. As the key branch of artificial intelligence, a knowledge graph (KG) is helpful to structure, reason, and understand data. Objective: To improve the utilization value of the information and effectively aid researchers to combat COVID-19, we have constructed and successively released a unified linked data set named OpenKG-COVID19, which is one of the largest existing KGs related to COVID-19. OpenKG-COVID19 includes 10 interlinked COVID-19 subgraphs covering the topics of encyclopedia, concept, medical, research, event, health, epidemiology, goods, prevention, and character. Methods: In this paper, we introduce the key techniques exploited in building COVID-19 KGs in a top-down manner. First, the schema of the modeling process for each KG in OpenKG-COVID19 is described. Second, we propose different methods for extracting knowledge from open government sites, professional texts, public domain–specific sources, and public encyclopedia sites. The curated 10 COVID-19 KGs are further linked together at both the schema and data levels. In addition, we present the naming convention for OpenKG-COVID19. Results: OpenKG-COVID19 has more than 2572 concepts, 329,600 entities, 513 properties, and 2,687,329 facts, and the data set will be updated continuously. Each COVID-19 KG was evaluated, and the average precision was found to be above 93%. We have developed search and browse interfaces and a SPARQL endpoint to improve user access. Possible intelligent applications based on OpenKG-COVID19 for further development are also described. Conclusions: A KG is useful for intelligent question-answering, semantic searches, recommendation systems, visualization analysis, and decision-making support. Research related to COVID-19, biomedicine, and many other communities can benefit from OpenKG-COVID19. Furthermore, the 10 KGs will be continuously updated to ensure that the public will have access to sufficient and up-to-date knowledge.},

Jung’s vision of psychology as the foundational science upon which all sciences and institutions would be based, and as the discipline, theory, and practice necessary for fostering humanity’s overall psychocultural development. Jung identified eight distinct ‘types’ of consciousness through which humankind engages its emerging psychological attitude. Jung’s view of psychological development as hingeing on the differentiation of function-attitudes provides the means for understanding not only ourselves and each other, but our society as well. This paper offers an example of such an analysis by focusing on the current conflict within American political culture. The goal is as lofty as it is necessary: the operationalization of Jung’s vision of psychology as the powerful influencer of human cultural evolution that it has the potential to be. The immediate goal is to instigate the first step toward this vision of Jung’s ‘complex psychology’ by stimulating conversations among Jungians about how they can foster that vision, leading them towards taking up roles as ‘citizen therapists’, actively involved in their communities in cultivating greater empathy and the withdrawal of projections in the interest of furthering ‘collective consciousness’.},

However, we have recognized the requirement to address QoE as multidimensional concept, and show the relationship between QoE, perceptual dimensions, and influence factors. In this paper, we provide the multidimensional modelling and analysis of QoE for video streaming. Result analysis has shown that QoE for video streaming can be modelled by using perception of quality of video and perception of ease of use of application as predictors. The analysis of influence of individual system (i.e., resolution, coding tree unit (CTU), and constant rate factor (CRF)), context (i.e., location, lighting, and video type), and human (i.e., gender, education level, and prior experience) factors and their interactions on QoE perceptual dimensions (i.e., perception of quality and perception of ease of use) show statistically significant impacts, which means that alternations of these factors can enhance perceptual dimensions and consequently QoE for video streaming which is a final goal.},

One of the main causes of the fast spreading of this virus is the direct contact of people with each other. There are many precautionary measures to reduce the spread of this virus; however, the major one is wearing face masks in public places. Detection of face masks in public places is a real challenge that needs to be addressed to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. To address these challenges, an automated system for face mask detection using deep learning (DL) algorithms has been proposed to control the spreading of this infectious disease effectively. This work applies deep convolution neural network (DCNN) and MobileNetV2-based transfer learning models for effectual face mask detection. We evaluated the performance of these two models on two separate datasets, i.e., our developed dataset by considering real-world scenarios having 2500 images (dataset-1) and the dataset taken from PyImage Search Reader Prajna Bhandary and some random sources (dataset-2). The experimental results demonstrated that MobileNetV2 achieved 98% and 99% accuracies on dataset-1 and dataset-2, respectively, whereas DCNN achieved 97% accuracy on both datasets. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that the MobileNetV2-based transfer learning model would be an alternative to the DCNN model for highly accurate face mask detection.},

   abstract = {Background and aims: Seattle protocol biopsies for Barrett's Esophagus (BE) surveillance are labour intensive with low compliance. Dysplasia detection rates vary, leading to missed lesions. This can potentially be offset with computer aided detection. We have developed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify areas of dysplasia and where to target biopsy. Methods: 119 Videos were collected in high-definition white light and optical chromoendoscopy with i-scan (Pentax Hoya, Japan) imaging in patients with dysplastic and non-dysplastic BE (NDBE). We trained an indirectly supervised CNN to classify images as dysplastic/non-dysplastic using whole video annotations to minimise selection bias and maximise accuracy. The CNN was trained using 148,936 video frames (31 dysplastic patients, 31 NDBE, two normal esophagus), validated on 25,161 images from 11 patient videos and tested on 264 iscan-1 images from 28 dysplastic and 16 NDBE patients which included expert delineations. To localise targeted biopsies/delineations, a second directly supervised CNN was generated based on expert delineations of 94 dysplastic images from 30 patients. This was tested on 86 i-scan one images from 28 dysplastic patients. Findings: The indirectly supervised CNN achieved a per image sensitivity in the test set of 91%, specificity 79%, area under receiver operator curve of 93% to detect dysplasia. Per-lesion sensitivity was 100%. Mean assessment speed was 48 frames per second (fps). 97% of targeted biopsy predictions matched expert and histological assessment at 56 fps. The artificial intelligence system performed better than six endoscopists. Interpretation: Our CNNs classify and localise dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus potentially supporting endoscopists during surveillance.},

Chest X-Rays (CXR) have been an important imaging modality for assisting in the diagnosis and management of hospitalised Covid-19 patients. However, their interpretation is time intensive for radiologists. Accurate computer aided systems can facilitate early diagnosis of Covid-19 and effective triaging. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic based deep learning (DL) approach to differentiate between CXR images of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia and with interstitial pneumonias not related to Covid-19. The developed model here, referred to as CovNNet, is used to extract some relevant features from CXR images, combined with fuzzy images generated by a fuzzy edge detection algorithm. Experimental results show that using a combination of CXR and fuzzy features, within a deep learning approach by developing a deep network inputed to a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), results in a higher classification performance (accuracy rate up to 81%), compared to benchmark deep learning approaches. The approach has been validated through additional datasets which are continously generated due to the spread of the virus and would help triage patients in acute settings. A permutation analysis is carried out, and a simple occlusion methodology for explaining decisions is also proposed. The proposed pipeline can be easily embedded into present clinical decision support systems.},

The problem of determining the most appropriate IoT system depends on many factors, often expressed by incomplete and uncertain estimates. In order to find a feasible decision, this study develops a multi-criteria framework for IoT solution selection in a fuzzy environment. In the proposed framework, a new modification of the Multi-Attribute Border approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) method with a specific distance measure via intuitionistic fuzzy values has been presented as a decision analysis method. The new technique is more precise than existing crisp and fuzzy analogues, as it includes the three components of intuitionistic numbers (degree of membership, degree of non-membership and hesitancy degree) and the relationships between them. The effectiveness of the new decision-making framework has been verified through an illustrative example of ranking IoT platforms.},

   abstract = {Background: Canadians are increasingly gaining web-based access to digital health services, and they expect to access their data from these services through a central patient access channel. Implementing data sharing between these services will require patient trust that is fostered through meaningful consent and consent management. Understanding user consent requirements and information needs is necessary for developing a trustworthy and transparent consent management system. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore consent management preferences and information needs to support meaningful consent. Methods: A secondary analysis of a national survey was conducted using a retrospective descriptive study design. The 2019 cross-sectional survey used a series of vignettes and consent scenarios to explore Canadians' privacy perspectives and preferences regarding consent management. Nonparametric tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the differences and associations between various factors. Results: Of the 1017 total responses, 716 (70.4%) participants self-identified as potential users. Of the potential users, almost all (672/716, 93.8%) felt that the ability to control their data was important, whereas some (385/716, 53.8%) believed that an all or none control at the data source level was adequate. Most potential users preferred new data sources to be accessible by health care providers (546/716, 76.3%) and delegated parties (389/716, 54.3%) by default. Prior digital health use was associated with greater odds of granting default access when compared with no prior use, with the greatest odds of granting default access to digital health service providers (odds ratio 2.17, 95% CI 1.36-3.46). From a list of 9 information elements found in consent forms, potential users selected an average of 5.64 (SD 2.68) and 5.54 (SD 2.85) items to feel informed in consenting to data access by care partners and commercial digital health service providers, respectively. There was no significant difference in the number of items selected between the 2 scenarios (P>.05); however, there were significant differences (P<.05) in information types that were selected between the scenarios. Conclusions: A majority of survey participants reported that they would register and use a patient access channel and believed that the ability to control data access was important, especially as it pertains to access by those outside their care. These findings suggest that a broad all or none approach based on data source may be accepted; however, approximately one-fifth of potential users were unable to decide. Although vignettes were used to introduce the questions, this study showed that more context is required for potential users to make informed consent decisions. Understanding their information needs will be critical, as these needs vary with the use case, highlighting the importance of prioritizing and tailoring information to enable meaningful consent.},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes are currently being sequenced at an unprecedented pace. The choice of viral sequences used in genetic and epidemiological analysis is important as it can induce biases that detract from the value of these rich datasets. This raises questions about how a set of sequences should be chosen for analysis, and which epidemiological parameters derived from genomic data are sensitive or robust to changes in sampling. We provide initial insights on these largely understudied problems using SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from Hong Kong, China, and the Amazonas State, Brazil. We consider sampling schemes that select sequences uniformly, in proportion or reciprocally with case incidence and which simply use all available sequences (unsampled). We apply Birth-Death Skyline and Skygrowth methods to estimate the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) and growth rate (rt) under these strategies as well as related R0 and date of origin parameters. We compare these to estimates from case data derived from EpiFilter, which we use as a reference for assessing bias. We find that both Rt and rt are sensitive to changes in sampling whilst R0 and the date of origin are relatively robust. Moreover, we find that analysis using unsampled datasets, which reflect an opportunistic sampling scheme, result in the most biased Rt and rt estimates for both our Hong Kong and Amazonas case studies. We highlight that sampling strategy choices may be an influential yet neglected component of sequencing analysis pipelines. More targeted attempts at genomic surveillance and epidemic analyses, particularly in settings with limited sequencing capabilities, are necessary to maximise the informativeness of virus genomic datasets.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementN.R.F. acknowledges support from Wellcome Trust and Royal Society Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (204311/Z/16/Z), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-034540) and Medical Research Council-Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) CADDE partnership award (MR/S0195/1 and FAPESP 18/14389-0) (https://caddecentre.org).

   abstract = {This study investigated the relationships among perceived stress, conflict resolution styles, spousal support and marital satisfaction of heterosexual married couples during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) quarantine. This was a descriptive study that employed a correlational survey model. The sample consisted of 511 Turkish married couples recruited using snowball sampling. Data were collected online using a demographic characteristic questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Conflict Resolution Styles Scale, the Spousal Support Scale, and the Marital Life Scale. The mean age of participants was 37.00 (SD = 7.88) years. The mean duration of marriage of participants was 11.15 (SD = 8.97) years. Higher marital satisfaction was associated with lower perceived stress, lower negative conflict resolution style, higher spousal support, and higher positive resolution styles. The Conflict Resolution Styles Scale and Spousal Support Scale scores explained 48.3% of the total variance of the Marital Life Scale, indicating that higher positive conflict resolution styles and higher spousal support were significantly associated with higher marital satisfaction. The COVID-19 quarantine has resulted in changes in marital life and family dynamics. Stress, negative conflict resolution style, and a lack of spousal support during the COVID-19 quarantine contribute to marital dissatisfaction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

However, air pollution is influenced by many external factors, one of which has recently been caused by the restrictions applied to curb the relentless advance of COVID-19. These sudden changes in air quality levels can negatively influence current forecasting models. This work compares air pollution forecasts during a pandemic and non-pandemic period under the same conditions. The ConvLSTM algorithm was applied to predict the concentration of nitrogen dioxide using data from the air quality and meteorological stations in Madrid. The proposed model was applied for two scenarios: pandemic (January–June 2020) and non-pandemic (January–June 2019), each with sub-scenarios based on time granularity (1-h, 12-h, 24-h and 48-h) and combination of features.

Study design Ecological study. Study setting Secondary data were collected for a total of 64 districts of Bangladesh. Methods The data for district-wise COVID-19 cases were collected from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh from March 2020 to June 2020. Socioeconomic and demographic data were collected from National Census Data, 2011. Retrospective spatial analysis was conducted based on district-wise COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh. Global Moran's I was adopted to find out the significance of the clusters. Furthermore, generalised linear model was conducted to find out the association of COVID-19 cases with sociodemographic variables. Results Total 87 054 COVID-19 cases were included in this study. The epidemic hotspots were distributed in the 11 most populous cities. The most likely clusters are primarily situated in the central, south-eastern and north-western regions of the country. High-risk clusters were found in Dhaka (Relative Risk (RR): 5.22), Narayanganj (RR: 2.70), Chittagong (RR: 1.69), Munshiganj (RR: 2.31) Cox's Bazar (RR: 1.63), Faridpur (RR: 1.65), Gazipur (RR: 1.33), Bogra (RR: 1.35), Khulna (RR: 1.22), Barishal (RR: 1.07) and Noakhali (RR: 1.06). Weekly progression of COVID-19 cases showed spatially clustered by Moran's I statistics (p value ranging from 0.013 to 0.436). After fitting a Poisson linear model, we found a positive association of COVID-19 with floating population rate (RR=1.542, 95% CI 1.520 to 1.564), and urban population rate (RR=1.027, 95% CI 1.026 to 1.028). Conclusion This study found the high-risk cluster areas in Bangladesh and analysed the basic epidemiological issues; further study is needed to find out the common risk behaviour of the patients and other relative issues that involve the spreading of this infectious disease.},

The primary aim of this review study is to explore current research and development perspectives that utilizes the ML techniques to predict the optimal mode of childbirth and to detect various complications during childbirth. A total of 26 articles (published between 2000 and 2020) from an initial set of 241 articles were selected and reviewed following a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach. As outcomes, this review study highlighted the objectives or focuses of the recent studies conducted on pregnancy outcomes using ML; explored the adopted ML algorithms along with their performances; and provided a synthesized view of features used, types of features, data sources and its characteristics. Besides, the review investigated and depicted how the objectives of the prior studies have changed with time being; and the association among the objectives of the studies, uses of algorithms, and the features. The study also delineated future research opportunities to facilitate the existing initiatives for reducing maternal complacent and mortality rates, such as: utilizing unsupervised and deep learning algorithms for prediction, revealing the unknown reasons of maternal complications, developing usable and useful ML-based clinical decision support systems to be used by the expecting mothers and health professionals, enhancing dataset and its accessibility, and exploring the potentiality of surgical robotic tools. Finally, the findings of this review study contributed to the development of a conceptual framework for advancing the ML-based maternal healthcare system. All together, this review will provide a state-of-the-art paradigm of ML-based maternal healthcare that will aid in clinical decision-making, anticipating pregnancy problems and delivery mode, and medical diagnosis and treatment.},

   abstract = {This article uses Deep Learning technologies to safeguard DNA sequencing against Bio-Cyber attacks. We consider a hybrid attack scenario where the payload is encoded into a DNA sequence to activate a Trojan malware implanted in a software tool used in the sequencing pipeline in order to allow the perpetrators to gain control over the resources used in that pipeline during sequence analysis. The scenario considered in the paper is based on perpetrators submitting synthetically engineered DNA samples that contain digitally encoded IP address and port number of the perpetrator’s machine in the DNA. Genetic analysis of the sample’s DNA will decode the address that is used by the software Trojan malware to activate and trigger a remote connection. This approach can open up to multiple perpetrators to create connections to hijack the DNA sequencing pipeline. As a way of hiding the data, the perpetrators can avoid detection by encoding the address to maximise similarity with genuine DNAs, which we showed previously. However, in this paper we show how Deep Learning can be used to successfully detect and identify the trigger encoded data, in order to protect a DNA sequencing pipeline from Trojan attacks. The result shows nearly up to 100% accuracy in detection in such a novel Trojan attack scenario even after applying fragmentation encryption and steganography on the encoded trigger data. In addition, feasibility of designing and synthesizing encoded DNA for such Trojan payloads is validated by a wet lab experiment.},

These processes have been expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and attention is drawn to the technology-driven organisational and operational innovations that are transforming academic divisions of labour and labour processes. These changes, particularly in relation to the separation of research and teaching, and to the deprofessionalisation, modularisation, and outsourcing of the latter, are the focus of the paper. We argue that the formal subsumption of knowledge production (research) through commercialisation dovetails with a real subsumption of socially reproductive work (teaching) that is undergoing qualitative transformation in an increasingly marketised higher education sector. We show how digitalisation actively contributes to the growing standardisation and flexibilisation of work, deepens long-standing gendered divisions of labour, and dissolves even further the blurred work/life boundaries for precariously employed workers. These new hallmarks of the contemporary subsumption present new challenges to workers and their collective organisations in Higher Education.},

For example, which countermeasures are appropriate at a particular stage of the pandemic? How can the severity of the pandemic be measured? What is the effect of vaccination in the population and which groups should be vaccinated first? The process of decision-making starts with data collection and modeling and continues to the dissemination of results and the subsequent decisions taken. The goal of this paper is to give an overview of this process and to provide recommendations for the different steps from a statistical perspective. In particular, we discuss a range of modeling techniques including mathematical, statistical and decision-analytic models along with their applications in the COVID-19 context. With this overview, we aim to foster the understanding of the goals of these modeling approaches and the specific data requirements that are essential for the interpretation of results and for successful interdisciplinary collaborations. A special focus is on the role played by data in these different models, and we incorporate into the discussion the importance of statistical literacy and of effective dissemination and communication of findings.},

   abstract = {Various studies have looked into the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on large populations. However, very few studies have looked into the remote setting of hospitals where vaccination is challenging due to social structure, myths, and misconceptions. There is a consensus that elevated inflammatory markers such as CRP, ferritin, D-dimer correlate with increased severity of COVID-19 and are associated with worse outcomes. In the present study, through retrospective meta-analysis, we have looked into ~20 months of SARS-COV2 infected patients with known mortality status and identified predictors of mortality concerning their comorbidities, various clinical parameters, inflammatory markers, superimposed infections, length of hospitalization, length of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Studies with larger sample sizes have covered the outcomes through epidemiological, social, and survey-based analysishowever, most studies cover larger cohorts from tertiary medical centers.

   abstract = {Research on the role of affect in the entrepreneurial process has surged over time, resulting in a vibrant field of inquiry. To advance scholarship in this area, we conduct an inductive analysis of 162 published articles, critically analyzing the state of research on affect in entrepreneurship. We develop an organizing framework to capture three major conversations in existing research—affect valence (feelings), discrete emotions, and emotional competencies—and encompass several outcomes studied within each conversation. We find that limited work has been done to explore the antecedents of affect (both feelings and discrete emotions), anticipated affect deserves greater consideration, and affective influence of stakeholders on entrepreneurs remains overlooked. Research on negative affect and emotional competencies also remains scarce in the entrepreneurship literature. Future inquiry would do well to take a multilevel approach to affect, explore affective phenomena over time, and cast light on the role of emotional competencies in the entrepreneurial process. We also spotlight crucial empirical advancements, including big data and artificial intelligence, for affect research going forward.},

   abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) applications are making a considerable impact on healthcare. ML is a subtype of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that aims to improve the speed and accuracy of physicians' work. Countries are currently dealing with an overburdened healthcare system with a shortage of skilled physicians, where AI provides a big hope. The healthcare data can be used gainfully to identify the optimal trial sample, collect more data points, assess ongoing data from trial participants, and eliminate data-based errors. ML-based techniques assist in detecting early indicators of an epidemic or pandemic. This algorithm examines satellite data, news and social media reports, and even video sources to determine whether the sickness will become out of control. Using ML for healthcare can open up a world of possibilities in this field. It frees up healthcare providers' time to focus on patient care rather than searching or entering information. This paper studies ML and its need in healthcare, and then it discusses the associated features and appropriate pillars of ML for healthcare structure. Finally, it identified and discussed the significant applications of ML for healthcare. The applications of this technology in healthcare operations can be tremendously advantageous to the organisation. ML-based tools are used to provide various treatment alternatives and individualised treatments and improve the overall efficiency of hospitals and healthcare systems while lowering the cost of care. Shortly, ML will impact both physicians and hospitals. It will be crucial in developing clinical decision support, illness detection, and personalised treatment approaches to provide the best potential outcomes.},

The current study forecasts the emissions from the countries' four sectors – Transportation, Building, Waste, and Manufacturing/Construction. By extending the classical discrete grey forecasting model DGM (1, 1), a new data-driven time-series forecasting technique, called DGM (1, 1, α), is proposed and applied to forecast the emissions in these sectors till 2028 with an accuracy of over 95%. The results show that the emissions are generally increasing. However, China continues to show a decline in the emissions from the manufacturing and construction industries. Also, the Posterior-Variance Test is introduced to test whether a given forecasting model is qualified or unqualified for a given problem. The comparative analyses with three forecasting models – DGM (1,1), Even GM (1,1), and Grey Verhulst models –revealed the proposed model's feasibility, flexibility, and accuracy. The study concludes with important recommendations for the policy-makers to develop better emission mitigation policies.},

   abstract = {Background: Electronic medical records have opened opportunities to analyze clinical practice at large scale. Structured registries and coding procedures such as the International Classification of Primary Care further improved these procedures. However, a large part of the information about the state of patient and the doctors' observations is still entered in free text fields. The main function of those fields is to report the doctor's line of thought, to remind oneself and his or her colleagues on follow-up actions, and to be accountable for clinical decisions. These fields contain rich information that can be complementary to that in coded fields, and until now, they have been hardly used for analysis. Objective: This study aims to develop a prediction model to convert the free text information on COVID-19–related symptoms from out of hours care electronic medical records into usable symptom-based data that can be analyzed at large scale. Methods: The design was a feasibility study in which we examined the content of the raw data, steps and methods for modelling, as well as the precision and accuracy of the models. A data prediction model for 27 preidentified COVID-19–relevant symptoms was developed for a data set derived from the database of primary-care out-of-hours consultations in Flanders. A multiclass, multilabel categorization classifier was developed. We tested two approaches, which were (1) a classical machine learning–based text categorization approach, Binary Relevance, and (2) a deep neural network learning approach with BERTje, including a domain-adapted version. Ethical approval was acquired through the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine and the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Antwerpen (ref 20/50/693). Results: The sample set comprised 3957 fields. After cleaning, 2313 could be used for the experiments. Of the 2313 fields, 85% (n=1966) were used to train the model, and 15% (n=347) for testing. The normal BERTje model performed the best on the data. It reached a weighted F1 score of 0.70 and an exact match ratio or accuracy score of 0.38, indicating the instances for which the model has identified all correct codes. The other models achieved respectable results as well, ranging from 0.59 to 0.70 weighted F1. The Binary Relevance method performed the best on the data without a frequency threshold. As for the individual codes, the domain-adapted version of BERTje performs better on several of the less common objective codes, while BERTje reaches higher F1 scores for the least common labels especially, and for most other codes in general. Conclusions: The artificial intelligence model BERTje can reliably predict COVID-19–related information from medical records using text mining from the free text fields generated in primary care settings. This feasibility study invites researchers to examine further possibilities to use primary care routine data.},

A set of requirements is designed to ensure the edibility, printability, imperceptibility, and robustness of cyber-physical watermarking. An inkjet printer using safe food coloring is adapted to print a watermarked image on a recombinant luminescent silk protein taggant to enhance attack resistance.

   abstract = {Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, disinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories spread through many parts of society. However, the disinformation spreading through social media is, according to the literature, one of the causes of increased COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. In this context, the analysis of social media posts is particularly important, but the large amount of data exchanged on social media platforms requires specific methods. This is why machine learning and natural language processing models are increasingly applied to social media data. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the capability of the CamemBERT French-language model to faithfully predict the elaborated categories, with the knowledge that tweets about vaccination are often ambiguous, sarcastic, or irrelevant to the studied topic. Methods: A total of 901,908 unique French-language tweets related to vaccination published between July 12, 2021, and August 11, 2021, were extracted using Twitter's application programming interface (version 2; Twitter Inc). Approximately 2000 randomly selected tweets were labeled with 2 types of categorizations: (1) arguments for (pros) or against (cons) vaccination (health measures included) and (2) type of content (scientific, political, social, or vaccination status). The CamemBERT model was fine-tuned and tested for the classification of French-language tweets. The model's performance was assessed by computing the F1-score, and confusion matrices were obtained. Results: The accuracy of the applied machine learning reached up to 70.6% for the first classification (pro and con tweets) and up to 90% for the second classification (scientific and political tweets). Furthermore, a tweet was 1.86 times more likely to be incorrectly classified by the model if it contained fewer than 170 characters (odds ratio 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.86). Conclusions: The accuracy of the model is affected by the classification chosen and the topic of the message examined. When the vaccine debate is jostled by contested political decisions, tweet content becomes so heterogeneous that the accuracy of the model drops for less differentiated classes. However, our tests showed that it is possible to improve the accuracy by selecting tweets using a new method based on tweet length.},

The rapid increase in the number of infected patients worldwide enhances the exigency for medicines. However, precise therapeutic drugs are not available for COVID-19; thus, exhaustive research is critically required to unscramble the pathogenic tools and probable therapeutic targets for the development of effective therapy. This study utilizes a chemogenomics strategy, including computational tools for the identification of viral-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and molecular docking of potential chemical compounds available in antiviral, anticancer, and natural product-based libraries against these DEGs. We scrutinized the messenger RNA expression profile of SARS-CoV-2 patients, publicly available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information–Gene Expression Omnibus database, stratified them into different groups based on the severity of infection, superseded by identification of overlapping mild and severe infectious (MSI)-DEGs. The profoundly expressed MSI-DEGs were then subjected to trait-linked weighted co-expression network construction and hub module detection. The hub module MSI-DEGs were then exposed to enrichment (gene ontology + pathway) and protein–protein interaction network analyses where Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (ARHGEF1) gene conjectured in all groups and could be a probable target of therapy. Finally, we used the molecular docking and molecular dynamics method to identify inherent hits against the ARHGEF1 gene from antiviral, anticancer, and natural product-based libraries. Although the study has an identified significant association of the ARHGEF1 gene in COVID19; and probable compounds targeting it, using in silico methods, these targets need to be validated by both in vitro and in vivo methods to effectively determine their therapeutic efficacy against the devastating virus.},

Metabolites mirror the disease progression of an individual by acquiring extensive insights into the pathophysiological significance during disease progression. We provide a comprehensive view of metabolic characterization of sera from COVID-19 patients at all stages using untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis. As compared with the healthy controls, we observed different alteration patterns of circulating metabolites from the mild, severe and recovery stages, in both discovery cohort and validation cohort, which suggest that metabolic reprogramming of glucose metabolism and urea cycle are potential pathological mechanisms for COVID-19 progression.

Existing studies on the impact of pandemic spread-prevention measures on water consumption and wastewater treatment during the pandemic are reviewed. The water use and wastewater discharge in China through the COVID-19 period are then projected and analyzed using Multivariate Linear Regression. The projection is carried out for years 2019–2023 and covers an (estimated) full process of pre-pandemic, pandemic outbreak, and recovery phase and provides essential information for determining the complete phase impact of the COVID-19. Two scenarios, i.e. the recovery scenario and the business as usual scenario, are set to investigate the water use and wastewater generation characteristics after the pandemic. The results imply that in both scenarios, the water use in China shows a V-shaped trend from 2019 to 2023 and reached a low point in 2020 of 5,813✕108 m3. The wastewater discharge shows an increasing trend throughout the COVID period in both scenarios. The results are also compared with the water consumption and wastewater generation during the SARS-CoV-1 period. The implication for policymakers is the possible increase of water use and wastewater discharge in the post COVID period and the necessity to ensure the water supply and control of water pollution and wastewater discharge.},

   abstract = {The main purpose of this dissertation is to study the optimization problems and the value of information in various commercial settings, especially in the emerging platform economy.Chapter 1, "Data-Driven Asset Selling". Motivated by online asset selling marketplace business (e.g., used cars and real estate), we formulate a data-driven asset selling dynamic pricing framework which utilizes platforms' access to customers' online behavioral data. With mild assumptions on the demand model, careful characterization of the problem structure shows that the model admits some ideal properties that facilitate our regret analysis under our dynamic programming setting. Instead of studying the policy performance with a long horizon and large quantities of inventory, we study the asymptotic policy performance over a single unit of product as the demand rate grows. We propose a deterministic approximation policy (DA policy) and show that DA policy provides an upper bound for the original problem and its induced pricing policy achieves asymptotic optimality as the scale of the problem grows properly. Later we consider a dynamic pricing scenario where an idiosyncratic latent value for each asset is unknown. We propose a Thompson-Sampling-based and a MAP-based pricing and learning policy. Since the platform is restricted in an infrequent pricing environment, within each decision epoch, an adequate amount of customer online behavior records is available. Utilizing large-sample deviation properties, we are able to conduct regret analysis on the TS and MAP policies. Finally, we use numerical experiments to show that our proposed algorithms could improve the revenue performance significantly compared with an algorithm that is currently implemented by a leading used car platform. Besides, we find that using a simple deterministic proxy of demand forecast is mostly harmless, while accurate estimation of the idiosyncratic latent value can make significant differences. Simulations also reveal that in our problem setting, the exploration step in the TS policy may not help to outperform the MAP policy. This indicates that the effectiveness of exploration highly depends on the nature of the problem, which may be of independent interest.Chapter 2, "Cash Hedging Motivates Information Sharing in Supply Chains". Finance literature well documents that firms' cash hedging strategies heavily depend on the market conditions. Unsurprisingly, such decisions could be challenging for an upstream firm in a supply chain where the end market conditions are not transparent to him. In this paper, we study the interplay between firms' information sharing behaviors and cash hedging strategies in supply chains. First, we argue that the presence of a supplier's cash hedging decision may motivate downstream retailers' voluntary market information sharing with the supplier, since making the supplier more informed of the market conditions helps the retailer handle her risk in the wholesale price. This also forms a new reason why a supplier should consider hedging since the cash hedging decision itself can be used as a bargaining tool during the information sharing negotiation with his retailer. Then we find for homogeneous Cournot-competing retailers, asymmetric information-sharing outcomes could emerge as an equilibrium where publicly sharing information typically will not hurt, especially, sometimes it can achieve Pareto improvement of the supply chain and consumer welfare. Finally, when a single supplier serves multiple markets, the heterogeneity across market sizes and the correlation among market shocks play big roles in shaping the equilibrium. Especially in a simultaneous information-sharing game, greater market size heterogeneity and negatively correlated market shocks are more likely to result in the nonexistence of pure Nash equilibrium. When the Stackelberg sequence is introduced, greater market size heterogeneity and positively correlated market shocks are more likely to induce information sharing in the equilibrium. Furthermore, in the multi-market setting, the existence of an information-sharing channel may hurt retailers, the system as a whole, and consumer welfare.Chapter 3, "Display Optimization under the Multinomial Logit Choice Model: Balancing Revenue and Customer Satisfaction". In this paper, we consider an assortment optimization problem in which a platform must choose pairwise disjoint sets of assortments to offer across a series of T stages. Arriving customers begin their search process in the first stage and progress sequentially through the stages until their patience expires, at which point they make a multinomial-logit-based purchasing decision from among all products they have viewed throughout their search process. The goal is to choose the sequential displays of product offerings to maximize expected revenue. Additionally, we impose stage-specific constraints that ensure that as each customer progresses farther and farther through the T stages, there is a minimum level of "desirability" met by the collections of displayed products. We consider two related measures of desirability: purchase likelihood and expected utility derived from the offered assortments. In this way, the offered sequence of assortment must be both high earning and well-liked, which breaks from the traditional assortment setting, where customer considerations are generally not explicitly accounted for. We show that our assortment problem of interest is strongly NP-Hard, thus ruling out the existence of a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS). From an algorithmic standpoint, as a warm-up, we develop a simple constant factor approximation scheme in which we carefully stitch together myopically selected assortments for each stage. Our main algorithmic result consists of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), which combines a handful of structural results related to the make-up of the optimal assortment sequence within an approximate dynamic programming framework.},

   abstract = {Infectious diseases usually have the characteristics of rapid spread with a large impact range. Once they break out, they will cause a large area of infection, which creates tremendous health and security risks. Thus, early infectious disease monitoring and prevention are critical. Current surveillance systems can predict the incidence of infectious diseases to a certain extent. However, the diversity, inaccuracy and incompleteness of the data collected by sensors make it difficult to obtain accurate monitoring results. Moreover, the limited local resources of a monitoring system cannot process the increasing volume of data in a timely manner. To address these challenges, fuzzy logic and edge computing have been applied to infectious disease monitoring in recent years. This paper presents a comprehensive review of infectious disease monitoring technologies based on fuzzy logic and edge computing. Fuzzy neural networks in infectious disease surveillance are introduced in detail, followed by a brief study of applications of fuzzy systems in infectious disease surveillance. Finally, improvements in existing disease detection systems based on the combination of edge computing and fuzzy logic are described. The review shows that edge computing and fuzzy logic are complementary and that their combination greatly improves the processing efficiency and the storage space of the data. At the same time, with edge computing as the carrier, the combination of fuzzy logic, neural networks, expert systems and other technologies can effectively carry out disease prediction and diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Optimal oxygen distribution is one of the most important energy management problems in the modern iron and steel industry. Normally, the supply of the energy generation system is determined by the energy demand of manufacturing processes. However, the balance between supply and demand fluctuates frequently, owing to the uncertainty arising in manufacturing processes. In this study, we developed an optimal oxygen distribution strategy considering uncertain demands and proposed a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model with a budget-based uncertainty set that protects the initial distribution decisions with low conservativeness. The main goal of the TSRO model is to make “wait-and-see” decisions, maximizing energy profits, and make “here-and-now” decisions, minimizing operational stability and surplus/shortage penalty. To represent the uncertainty set of energy demands, we developed (1) a Gaussian process-based time-series model to forecast the demand intervals for continuous processes, and (2) a capacity-constrained scheduling model to generate multi-scenario demands for discrete processes. We performed extensive computational studies on TSRO and its components using well-synthesized instances from historical data. The results of model validation and analysis are promising and demonstrate that our approach is well adapted to solving industrial cases under uncertainty.},

   abstract = {The rapid growth of research publications has placed great demands on digital libraries (DL) for advanced information management technologies. To cater to these demands, techniques relying on knowledge-graph structures are being advocated. In such graph-based pipelines, inferring semantic relations between related scientific concepts is a crucial step. Recently, BERT-based pre-trained models have been popularly explored for automatic relation classification. Despite significant progress, most of them were evaluated in different scenarios, which limits their comparability. Furthermore, existing methods are primarily evaluated on clean texts, which ignores the digitization context of early scholarly publications in terms of machine scanning and optical character recognition (OCR). In such cases, the texts may contain OCR noise, in turn creating uncertainty about existing classifiers’ performances. To address these limitations, we started by creating OCR-noisy texts based on three clean corpora. Given these parallel corpora, we conducted a thorough empirical evaluation of eight Bert-based classification models by focusing on three factors: (1) Bert variants; (2) classification strategies; and, (3) OCR noise impacts. Experiments on clean data show that the domain-specific pre-trained Bert is the best variant to identify scientific relations. The strategy of predicting a single relation each time outperforms the one simultaneously identifying multiple relations in general. The optimal classifier’s performance can decline by around 10% to 20% in F-score on the noisy corpora. Insights discussed in this study can help DL stakeholders select techniques for building optimal knowledge-graph-based systems.},

   abstract = {As a cost-effective and objective population-wide surveillance tool, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been widely implemented worldwide to monitor the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA concentration in wastewater. However, viral concentrations or loads in wastewater often correlate poorly with clinical case numbers. To date, there is no reliable method to back-estimate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. This greatly limits WBE in achieving its full potential in monitoring the unfolding pandemic. The exponentially growing SARS-CoV-2 WBE dataset, on the other hand, offers an opportunity to develop data-driven models for the estimation of COVID-19 case numbers (both incidence and prevalence) and transmission dynamics (effective reproduction rate). This study developed artificial neural network (ANN) models by innovatively expanding a conventional WBE dataset to include catchment, weather, clinical testing coverage and vaccination rate. The ANN models were trained and evaluated with a comprehensive state-wide wastewater monitoring dataset from Utah, USA during May 2020 to December 2021. In diverse sewer catchments, ANN models were found to accurately estimate the COVID-19 prevalence and incidence rates, with excellent precision for prevalence rates. Also, an ANN model was developed to estimate the effective reproduction number from both wastewater data and other pertinent factors affecting viral transmission and pandemic dynamics. The established ANN model was successfully validated for its transferability to other states or countries using the WBE dataset from Wisconsin, USA.},

   abstract = {Background: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a concerning global health care issue, which is mainly caused by the uncertainty of patient arrivals, especially during the pandemic. Accurate forecasting of patient arrivals can allow health resource allocation in advance to reduce overcrowding. Currently, traditional data, such as historical patient visits, weather, holiday, and calendar, are primarily used to create forecasting models. However, data from an internet search engine (eg, Google) is less studied, although they can provide pivotal real-time surveillance information. The internet data can be employed to improve forecasting performance and provide early warning, especially during the epidemic. Moreover, possible nonlinearities between patient arrivals and these variables are often ignored. Objective: This study aims to develop an intelligent forecasting system with machine learning models and internet search index to provide an accurate prediction of ED patient arrivals, to verify the effectiveness of the internet search index, and to explore whether nonlinear models can improve the forecasting accuracy. Methods: Data on ED patient arrivals were collected from July 12, 2009, to June 27, 2010, the period of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. These included 139,910 ED visits in our collaborative hospital, which is one of the biggest public hospitals in Hong Kong. Traditional data were also collected during the same period. The internet search index was generated from 268 search queries on Google to comprehensively capture the information about potential patients. The relationship between the index and patient arrivals was verified by Pearson correlation coefficient, Johansen cointegration, and Granger causality. Linear and nonlinear models were then developed with the internet search index to predict patient arrivals. The accuracy and robustness were also examined. Results: All models could accurately predict patient arrivals. The causality test indicated internet search index as a strong predictor of ED patient arrivals. With the internet search index, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the linear model reduced from 5.3% to 5.0% and from 24.44 to 23.18, respectively, whereas the MAPE and RMSE of the nonlinear model decreased even more, from 3.5% to 3% and from 16.72 to 14.55, respectively. Compared with each other, the experimental results revealed that the forecasting system with extreme learning machine, as well as the internet search index, had the best performance in both forecasting accuracy and robustness analysis. Conclusions: The proposed forecasting system can make accurate, real-time prediction of ED patient arrivals. Compared with the static traditional variables, the internet search index significantly improves forecasting as a reliable predictor monitoring continuous behavior trend and sudden changes during the epidemic (P=.002). The nonlinear model performs better than the linear counterparts by capturing the dynamic relationship between the index and patient arrivals. Thus, the system can facilitate staff planning and workflow monitoring.},

Today people outside the academy encounter cutting-edge historical scholarship by way of their daily newspaper, blogs and online news sites, TV and films, the Broadway stage, historic places, debates over renaming streets and removing statues, and genealogy projects. At the same time, historians face challenges from budget-cutting administrators (in universities, libraries, and museums) and from cynical politicians who seek to replace truth with myth, in the process roiling state legislators and members of local school boards. Consequently, historians today contend with two major opposing forces - on the one hand, a proliferation of lively venues that bring inclusive stories about the past to a wider audience, and, on the other, political conditions that lead to the intimidation of historians regardless of where they work. In the face of these challenges, the AHA must continue its robust advocacy work on behalf of all historians.},

   abstract = {Background: New artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being developed at a high speed. However, strategies and practical experiences surrounding the adoption and implementation of AI in health care are lacking. This is likely because of the high implementation complexity of AI, legacy IT infrastructure, and unclear business cases, thus complicating AI adoption. Research has recently started to identify the factors influencing AI readiness of organizations. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing AI readiness as well as possible barriers to AI adoption and implementation in German hospitals. We also assessed the status quo regarding the dissemination of AI tools in hospitals. We focused on IT decision makers, a seldom studied but highly relevant group. Methods: We created a web-based survey based on recent AI readiness and implementation literature. Participants were identified through a publicly accessible database and contacted via email or invitational leaflets sent by mail, in some cases accompanied by a telephonic prenotification. The survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: We contacted 609 possible participants, and our database recorded 40 completed surveys. Most participants agreed or rather agreed with the statement that AI would be relevant in the future, both in Germany (37/40, 93%) and in their own hospital (36/40, 90%). Participants were asked whether their hospitals used or planned to use AI technologies. Of the 40 participants, 26 (65%) answered ``yes.'' Most AI technologies were used or planned for patient care, followed by biomedical research, administration, and logistics and central purchasing. The most important barriers to AI were lack of resources (staff, knowledge, and financial). Relevant possible opportunities for using AI were increase in efficiency owing to time-saving effects, competitive advantages, and increase in quality of care. Most AI tools in use or in planning have been developed with external partners. Conclusions: Few tools have been implemented in routine care, and many hospitals do not use or plan to use AI in the future. This can likely be explained by missing or unclear business cases or the need for a modern IT infrastructure to integrate AI tools in a usable manner. These shortcomings complicate decision-making and resource attribution. As most AI technologies already in use were developed in cooperation with external partners, these relationships should be fostered. IT decision makers should assess their hospitals' readiness for AI individually with a focus on resources. Further research should continue to monitor the dissemination of AI tools and readiness factors to determine whether improvements can be made over time. This monitoring is especially important with regard to government-supported investments in AI technologies that could alleviate financial burdens. Qualitative studies with hospital IT decision makers should be conducted to further explore the reasons for slow AI.},

   abstract = {In mediation and negotiation, we sometimes encounter people who make decisions that seem to be inconsistent with what they say they care about and want, and with their alternatives to settlement. Some seemingly irrational decisions may be a result of automatic, intuitive moral judgments, which are best approached at a corresponding intuitive level. Social scientists have identified two “systems” of thinking: an automatic, quick process made outside of awareness (System 1), and an effortful, deliberate, logical, conscious one (System 2). In their social intuitionist model and moral foundations theory, Jonathan Haidt and colleagues propose that individuals make automatic, quick, intuitive moral judgments along five universal moral domains: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. These moral judgments are difficult to engage with reasoned arguments. A seemingly irrational party may be in the midst of an intuitive moral judgment that is not logic-based. The literature on these and related lines of research explains when and why a mediator should seek to explore whether a party’s assessments may be a result of intuitive moral judgments, and if so, ways a mediator could communicate with the party on that level. This may be done most effectively by shifting the focus within or to another relevant moral domain, using moral reframing, and making liberal use of stories in communicating alternative intuitive moral perspectives. These methods engage on an intuitive level.},

The emergence of viral diseases is expected to accelerate; these data indicate the need for a proactive approach to develop widely active family specific and cross family therapies for future disease outbreaks. Viral disease such as pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2, HIV infection, and Hepatitis-C virus can cause directly and indirectly cardiovascular disease (CVD). Emphasis should be placed not only on the development of broad-spectrum molecules and antibodies but also on host factor therapy, including the reutilization of previously approved or developing drugs. Another new class of therapeutics with great antiviral therapeutic potential is molecular communication networks using deep learning autoencoder (DL-AEs). The use of DL-AEs for diagnosis and prognosis prediction of infectious and noninfectious diseases has attracted a particular attention. MCN is map to molecular signaling and communication that are found inside and outside the human body where the goal is to develop a new black box mechanism that can serve the future robust healthcare industry (HCI). MCN has the ability to characterize the signaling process between cells and infectious disease locations at various levels of the human body called point-to-point MCN through DL-AE and provide targeted drug delivery (TDD) environment. Through MCN, and DL-AE healthcare provider can remotely measure biological signals and control certain processes in the required organism for the maintenance of the patient's health state.

Then, next development of molecular diagnosis such as heart sounds is classified. Furthermore, biohealth interface for the inside and outside human body mechanism is presented, comparative perspective with up-to-date current situation about MCN.},

Twitter provides an unfiltered and timestamped feed of information that can be aggregated to generate valuable insights. Our research aims to identify passenger-related transit incidents from a public Twitter feed. Detecting these incidents in real time enables transit agencies to immediately respond to them by dispatching security, safety, or maintenance crews or by rapidly replying to requests made to the agency that are urgent in nature. We leverage natural language processing to extract latent information from identified eyewitness tweets about transit, focusing on location details, topic classification, and sentiment analysis. We outline an approach to developing a useful corpus of transit-focused tweets, detecting in the moment events, classifying these tweets into topics, and detecting locations where possible. We then demonstrate the approach through an application to Calgary Transit in Calgary, Canada. The results demonstrate that key incidents can be identified and prioritized for an agency.},

   abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) in humans is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). It is estimated that 70 million children (<15 years) are currently infected with Mtb, with 1.2 million each year progressing to disease. Of these, a quarter die. The risk of progression from Mtb infection to disease and from disease to death is dependent on multiple pathogen and host factors. Age is a central component in all these transitions. The natural history of TB in children and adolescents is different to adults, leading to unique challenges in the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The quantification of RNA transcripts in specific cells or in the peripheral blood, using high-throughput methods, such as microarray analysis or RNA-Sequencing, can shed light into the host immune response to Mtb during infection and disease, as well as understanding treatment response, disease severity, and vaccination, in a global hypothesis-free manner. Additionally, gene expression profiling can be used for biomarker discovery, to diagnose disease, predict future disease progression and to monitor response to treatment. Here, we review the role of transcriptomics in children and adolescents, focused mainly on work done in blood, to understand disease biology, and to discriminate disease states to assist clinical decision-making. In recent years, studies with a specific pediatric and adolescent focus have identified blood gene expression markers with diagnostic or prognostic potential that meet or exceed the current sensitivity and specificity targets for diagnostic tools. Diagnostic and prognostic gene expression signatures identified through high-throughput methods are currently being translated into diagnostic tests.},

Heterologous messenger RNA (mRNA) booster immunization induced higher serum neutralizing antibody and MBC responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) compared with that of homologous ChAdOx1 boosting. Specificity mapping of circulating B cells revealed that mRNA-1273 boost immunofocused ChAdOx1-primed responses onto epitopes expressed on prefusion-stabilized S. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from mRNA-1273Ðboosted participants displayed overall higher binding affinities and increased breadth of reactivity against VOCs relative to those isolated from ChAdOx1-boosted individuals. Overall, the results provide molecular insight into the enhanced quality of the B cell response induced after heterologous mRNA booster vaccination. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

For the identification and classification of COVID-19, this research presents a three-stage ensemble boosted convolutional neural network model. A conventional segmentation model (ResUNet) is used to increase the model's performance in the initial step of processing the CXR datasets. In the second step, the CNN is used to extract the features from the pictures in the training dataset using machine learning techniques. Using machine learning (ML) techniques, the retrieved characteristics are then combined by voting in the third stage. There are 5178 aberrant CXR photos and 4310 normal CXR images used in this investigation. Models like CNN and ML can't compete with the suggested model. 99.35% of the model's measurements are accurate and precise, and 98% of its recall and F1-score are perfect. It is argued that the suggested model provides a rigorous and trustworthy evaluation of clinical decision-making in the setting of a public health crisis.},

   abstract = {With the advancement of affordable self-driving vehicles using complicated nonlinear optimization but limited computation resources, computation time becomes a matter of concern. Other factors such as actuator dynamics and actuator command processing cost also unavoidably cause delays. In high-speed scenarios, these delays are critical to the safety of a vehicle. Recent works consider these delays individually, but none unifies them all in the context of autonomous driving. Moreover, recent works inappropriately consider computation time as a constant or a large upper bound, which makes the control either less responsive or over-conservative. To deal with all these delays, we present a unified framework by 1) modeling actuation dynamics, 2) using robust tube model predictive control, and 3) using a novel adaptive Kalman filter without assuming a known process model and noise covariance, which makes the controller safe while minimizing conservativeness. On the one hand, our approach can serve as a standalone controller; on the other hand, our approach provides a safety guard for a high-level controller, which assumes no delay. This can be used for compensating the sim-to-real gap when deploying a black-box learning-enabled controller trained in a simplistic environment without considering delays for practical vehicle systems.},

In order to detect and track the suspected COVID-19 infected people and consequently limit the pandemic spread, this paper entails a framework integrating the machine learning (ML), cloud, fog, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to propose a novel smart COVID-19 disease monitoring and prognosis system. The proposal leverages the IoT devices that collect streaming data from both medical (e.g., X-ray machine, lung ultrasound machine, etc.) and non-medical (e.g., bracelet, smartwatch, etc.) devices. Moreover, the proposed hybrid fog-cloud framework provides two kinds of federated ML as a service (federated MLaaS); (i) the distributed batch MLaaS that is implemented on the cloud environment for a long-term decision-making, and (ii) the distributed stream MLaaS, which is installed into a hybrid fog-cloud environment for a short-term decision-making. The stream MLaaS uses a shared federated prediction model stored into the cloud, whereas the real-time symptom data processing and COVID-19 prediction are done into the fog. The federated ML models are determined after evaluating a set of both batch and stream ML algorithms from the Python’s libraries. The evaluation considers both the quantitative (i.e., performance in terms of accuracy, precision, root mean squared error, and F1 score) and qualitative (i.e., quality of service in terms of server latency, response time, and network latency) metrics to assess these algorithms. This evaluation shows that the stream ML algorithms have the potential to be integrated into the COVID-19 prognosis allowing the early predictions of the suspected COVID-19 cases.},

   abstract = {Processing lightweight machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as decision tree ensemble (DTE), on low-power edge devices is beneficial; however, these devices usually have limited resources, and domain-specific accelerators are not readily available. Therefore, energy- and resource-efficient acceleration mechanisms for ML workloads on lightweight embedded microcontrollers without additional hardware accelerators are desired. However, the penalties associated with branch mispredictions can be performance bottlenecks when executing DTE on conventional in-order pipelined processors. This study proposes the Guided Branch Approximation (GBA), an approximate computing approach to improve the performance of DTE on lightweight general-purpose processors by selectively ignoring the correctness of branch instructions. GBA enhances the performance by speculatively executing selected branch instructions without any rollback on branch mispredictions. GBA allows programmers and high-level ML frameworks to annotate approximal branch instructions and to ensure target applications’ quality of service (QoS). GBA comprises the following: 1) the approximate branch instruction format, a new type of branch instruction that ignores the wrong prediction of branch predictors, and 2) a hardware-based QoS mechanism that dynamically manages the execution of approximable branch instructions to prevent undesirable QoS degradation. We evaluate the proposed idea on an in-order pipeline processor using a software simulator. Experiments show that GBA can reduce the total execution time by more than 15 % while preserving the QoS of the DTE algorithm in the best-case scenario with a slight modification to the hardware.},

Unfortunately, blind, and partially sighted learners still lack an inclusive and effective drawing tool, even in the digital age. In response, this research aims to explore what an effective drawing tool for blind and partially sighted individuals (BPSI) would be. Raised-line drawing kits aim to provide this, but in prior work, our usability tests of raised line graphics with blind and partially sighted participants rated the raised line graphics that we tested as barely comprehensible relative to 3D models, which they rated as highly comprehensible. Semi-structured interviews with our participants afterward suggest that they found 3D models to be more comprehensible because these are consistent with haptic principles of perception whereas conventions of raised line graphics, such as a line representing a surface edge, replicate visual cues of source images and thereby violate haptic principles of perception. Therefore, we hypothesize that a drawing tool for blind and partially sighted drawers could be effective by recruiting affordances of 3D models. Through co-design sessions conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic with blind and partially sighted drawers (BPSD), we prototyped a tangible 3D model construction kit for non-visual haptic drawing with a digital interface to a 3D virtual environment. Our current investigation of user needs is informing us of our ongoing iterative development of an accessible 3D scanning application that is enabling blind and partially sighted individuals to build and scan in 3D models constructed from a more flexible range of materials beyond what was possible with our previous prototype.},

Theoretical research in psychology shows that one’s emotional state can influence his/her temporal orientation. We hypothesize that measuring human temporal orientation can benefit from concurrent learning of emotion. To test this hypothesis, we propose a deep learning-based multi-task framework where we concurrently learn a unified model for temporal orientation (our primary task) and emotion analysis (secondary task) using tweets. Our multi-task framework takes users’ tweets as input and produces three temporal orientation labels (past, present or future) and four emotion labels (joy, sadness, anger, or fear) with intensity values as outputs. The classified tweets are then grouped for each user to obtain the user-level temporal orientation and emotion. Finally, we investigate the associations between the users’ temporal orientation and their emotional state. Our analysis reveals that joy and anger are correlated to future orientation while sadness and fear are correlated to the past orientation.},

   abstract = {Objective To create and validate a simple and transferable machine learning model from electronic health record data to accurately predict clinical deterioration in patients with covid-19 across institutions, through use of a novel paradigm for model development and code sharing. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting One US hospital during 2015-21 was used for model training and internal validation. External validation was conducted on patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at 12 other US medical centers during 2020-21. Participants 33 119 adults (≥18 years) admitted to hospital with respiratory distress or covid-19. Main outcome measures An ensemble of linear models was trained on the development cohort to predict a composite outcome of clinical deterioration within the first five days of hospital admission, defined as in-hospital mortality or any of three treatments indicating severe illness: mechanical ventilation, heated high flow nasal cannula, or intravenous vasopressors. The model was based on nine clinical and personal characteristic variables selected from 2686 variables available in the electronic health record. Internal and external validation performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the expected calibration error-the difference between predicted risk and actual risk. Potential bed day savings were estimated by calculating how many bed days hospitals could save per patient if low risk patients identified by the model were discharged early. Results 9291 covid-19 related hospital admissions at 13 medical centers were used for model validation, of which 1510 (16.3%) were related to the primary outcome. When the model was applied to the internal validation cohort, it achieved an AUROC of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.84) and an expected calibration error of 0.01 (95% confidence interval 0.00 to 0.02). Performance was consistent when validated in the 12 external medical centers (AUROC range 0.77-0.84), across subgroups of sex, age, race, and ethnicity (AUROC range 0.78-0.84), and across quarters (AUROC range 0.73-0.83). Using the model to triage low risk patients could potentially save up to 7.8 bed days per patient resulting from early discharge. Conclusion A model to predict clinical deterioration was developed rapidly in response to the covid-19 pandemic at a single hospital, was applied externally without the sharing of data, and performed well across multiple medical centers, patient subgroups, and time periods, showing its potential as a tool for use in optimizing healthcare resources.},

   abstract = {The demand for an indoor localization system is increasing, and related research is also becoming more universal. Previous works on indoor localization systems mainly focus on the acoustic signals in Line of Sight (LOS) scenario to obtain accurate localization information, but their effectiveness in Nonline of Sight (NLOS) scenario remains comparatively untouched. These works are usually less efficient as the acoustic signals often bring diffraction, refraction, scattering, energy decays, and so on in NLOS environments. So the system needs adjusting accordingly in a complex NLOS scenario based on NLOS identification results. Therefore, the identification of NLOS acoustic signal turns out to be significant in the indoor localization system. If the system only uses original support vector machine (SVM) to complete NLOS identification, the result turns out to be poor by our test. To address this challenge, we propose a novel indoor localization system, named ZKLocPro, which utilizes an advanced swarm intelligence method to optimize the traditional SVM classification model to deal with NLOS acoustic signal identification. Its results can help the system adjust the localization process if necessary in a complex NLOS scenario. Obviously, it is also significant to build our own NLOS data set, which is suitable for an indoor localization system’s situation. Specifically, four methods are added: (1) new LOS and NLOS acoustic localization signal sample production, rearrangement, and reselecting process; (2) advanced parameter optimization process; (3) elitist strategy; and (4) inertia weight nonlinear decrement. The experimental result shows that our system is efficient and performs better than state-of-the-art congeneric works even in a complex NLOS scenario.},

Machine learning (ML) based prediction models provide a better solution to help patients’ health diagnoses in the health care industry. The objective of this research is to create a hybrid dataset to aid in the development of a best CVD risk prediction model. The Hungarian, the Switzerland, the Cleveland, and the Long Beach datasets are the most commonly used datasets in heart disease (HD) prediction. These datasets have a maximum of 303 instances with missing values in their features, and the presence of missing values reduces the accuracy of the prediction model. So, in this article, we created the ”Sathvi” dataset by combining these datasets, and it has 531 instances with 12 attributes with no missing data. The Pearson's correlation method was used to eliminate redundant features during the feature selection process. The Naive Bayes (NB), XGBoost, k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and CatBoost ML classifiers have been applied for prediction.

Scientists around the world are doing extensive research to control this disease. They are working tirelessly to find out the origin and causes of the disease. Several studies and experiments mentioned that there are some meteorological parameters which are highly correlated with COVID-19 transmission. In this work, we studied the effects of 11 meteorological parameters on the transmission of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We first applied statistical analysis and observed that there is no significant effect of these parameters. Therefore, we proposed a novel technique to analyze the insight effects of these parameters by using a combination of Random Forest, CART, and Lasso feature selection techniques. We observed that 4 parameters are highly influential for COVID-19 where Tmin and Cloud have positive association whereas WS and AQ have negative impact. Among them, Cloud has the highest positive impact which is 0.063 and WS has the highest negative association which is - 0.021. Moreover, we have validated our performance using DLNM technique. The result of this investigation can be used to develop an alert system that will assist the policymakers to know the characteristics of COVID-19 against meteorological parameters and can impose different policies based on the weather conditions.},

   abstract = {According to a recent Deloitte study, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to place a huge strain on the global health care sector. Covid-19 has also catalysed digital transformation across the sector for improving operational efficiencies. As a result, the amount of digitally stored patient data such as discharge letters, scan images, test results or free text entries by doctors has grown significantly. In 2020, 2314 exabytes of medical data was generated globally. This medical data does not conform to a generic structure and is mostly in the form of unstructured digitally generated or scanned paper documents stored as part of a patient’s medical reports. This unstructured data is digitised using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process. A key challenge here is that the accuracy of the OCR process varies due to the inability of current OCR engines to correctly transcribe scanned or handwritten documents in which text may be skewed, obscured or illegible. This is compounded by the fact that processed text is comprised of specific medical terminologies that do not necessarily form part of general language lexicons. The proposed work uses a deep neural network based self-supervised pre-training technique: Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RoBERTa) that can learn to predict hidden (masked) sections of text to fill in the gaps of non-transcribable parts of the documents being processed. Evaluating the proposed method on domain-specific datasets which include real medical documents, shows a significantly reduced word error rate demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.},

   abstract = {Currently, countries across the world are suffering from a prominent viral infection called COVID-19. Most countries are still facing several issues due to this disease, which has resulted in several fatalities. The first COVID-19 wave caused devastation across the world owing to its virulence and led to a massive loss in human lives, impacting the country's economy drastically. A dangerous disease called mucormycosis was discovered worldwide during the second COVID-19 wave, in 2021, which lasted from April to July. The mucormycosis disease is commonly known as "black fungus,"which belongs to the fungus family Mucorales. It is usually a rare disease, but the level of destruction caused by the disease is vast and unpredictable. This disease mainly targets people already suffering from other diseases and consuming heavy medication to counter the disease they are suffering from. This is because of the reduction in antibodies in the affected people. Therefore, the patient's body does not have the ability to act against fungus-oriented infections. This black fungus is more commonly identified in patients with coronavirus disease in certain country. The condition frequently manifests on skin, but it can also harm organs such as eyes and brain. This study intends to design a modified neural network logic for an artificial intelligence (AI) strategy with learning principles, called a hybrid learning-based neural network classifier (HLNNC). The proposed method is based on well-known techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM). This article discusses a dataset containing several eye photographs of patients with and without black fungus infection. These images were collected from the real-time records of people afflicted with COVID followed by the black fungus. This proposed HLNNC scheme identifies the black fungus disease based on the following image processing procedures: image acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification; these procedures were performed considering the dataset training and testing principles with proper performance analysis. The results of the procedure are provided in a graphical format with the precise specification, and the efficacy of the proposed method is established.},

Design Systematic analysis. Setting Participants were aged ≥70 from 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019. Main outcomes measures Years of life lost, years lived with disability, disability adjusted life years, life expectancy at age 70 (LE-70), healthy life expectancy at age 70 (HALE-70), proportion of years in ill health at age 70 (PYIH-70), risk factors, and data coverage index were estimated based on standardised GBD methods. Results Globally the population of older adults has increased since 1990 and all cause death rates have decreased for men and women. However, mortality rates due to falls increased between 1990 and 2019. The probability of death among people aged 70-90 decreased, mainly because of reductions in non-communicable diseases. Globally disability burden was largely driven by functional decline, vision and hearing loss, and symptoms of pain. LE-70 and HALE-70 showed continuous increases since 1990 globally, with certain regional disparities. Globally higher LE-70 resulted in higher HALE-70 and slightly increased PYIH-70. Sociodemographic and healthcare access and quality indices were positively correlated with HALE-70 and LE-70. For high exposure risk factors, data coverage was moderate, while limited data were available for various dietary, environmental or occupational, and metabolic risks. Conclusions Life expectancy at age 70 has continued to rise globally, mostly because of decreases in chronic diseases. Adults aged ≥70 living in high income countries and regions with better healthcare access and quality were found to experience the highest life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Disability burden, however, remained constant, suggesting the need to enhance public health and intervention programmes to improve wellbeing among older adults.},

This study evaluates the impact of state-level local vs. visitor mobility in understanding the growth with respect to the number of cases for COVID spread in the United States between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Two metrics, namely local and visitor transmission risk, were extracted from mobility data to capture the transmission potential of COVID-19 through mobility. A combination of the three factors: the current number of cases, local transmission risk, and the visitor transmission risk, are used to model the future number of cases using various machine learning models. The factors that contribute to better forecast performance are the ones that impact the number of cases. The statistical significance of the forecasts is also evaluated using the Diebold–Mariano test. Finally, the performance of models is compared for three waves across all 50 states. The results show that visitor mobility significantly impacts the case growth by improving the prediction accuracy by 33.78%. We also observe that the impact of visitor mobility is more pronounced during the first peak, i.e., March–June 2020.</p>},

   abstract = {Host-pathogen protein interactions (HPPIs) play vital roles in many biological processes and are directly involved in infectious diseases. With the outbreak of more frequent pandemics in the last couple of decades, such as the recent outburst of Covid-19 causing millions of deaths, it has become more critical to develop advanced methods to accurately predict pathogen interactions with their respective hosts. During the last decade, experimental methods to identify HPIs have been used to decipher host-pathogen systems with the caveat that those techniques are labor-intensive, expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, accurate prediction of HPIs can be performed by the use of data-driven machine learning. To provide a more robust and accurate solution for the HPI prediction problem, we have developed a deepHPI tool based on deep learning. The web server delivers four host-pathogen model types: plant-pathogen, human-bacteria, human-virus and animal-pathogen, leveraging its operability to a wide range of analyses and cases of use. The deepHPI web tool is the first to use convolutional neural network models for HPI prediction. These models have been selected based on a comprehensive evaluation of protein features and neural network architectures. The best prediction models have been tested on independent validation datasets, which achieved an overall Matthews correlation coefficient value of 0.87 for animal-pathogen using the combined pseudo-amino acid composition and conjoint triad (PAAC_CT) features, 0.75 for human-bacteria using the combined pseudo-amino acid composition, conjoint triad and normalized Moreau-Broto feature (PAAC_CT_NMBroto), 0.96 for human-virus using PAAC_CT_NMBroto and 0.94 values for plant-pathogen interactions using the combined pseudo-amino acid composition, composition and transition feature (PAAC_CTDC_CTDT). Our server running deepHPI is deployed on a high-performance computing cluster that enables large and multiple user requests, and it provides more information about interactions discovered. It presents an enriched visualization of the resulting host-pathogen networks that is augmented with external links to various protein annotation resources. We believe that the deepHPI web server will be very useful to researchers, particularly those working on infectious diseases. Additionally, many novel and known host-pathogen systems can be further investigated to significantly advance our understanding of complex disease-causing agents. The developed models are established on a web server, which is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.usu.edu/deepHPI/.},

This disease has infected millions of people worldwide. The inadequate availability and the limited sensitivity of the testing kits have motivated the clinicians and the scientist to use Computer Tomography (CT) scans to screen COVID-19. Recent advances in technology and the availability of deep learning approaches have proved to be very promising in detecting COVID-19 with increased accuracy. However, deep learning approaches require a huge labeled training dataset, and the current availability of benchmark COVID-19 data is still small. For the limited training data scenario, the CNN usually overfits after several iterations. Hence, in this work, we have investigated different pre-trained network architectures with transfer learning for COVID-19 detection that can work even on a small medical imaging dataset. Various variants of the pre-trained ResNet model, namely ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet101, are investigated in the current paper for the detection of COVID-19. The experimental results reveal that transfer learned ResNet50 model outperformed other models by achieving a recall of 98.80% and an F1-score of 98.41%. To further improvise the results, the activations from different layers of best performing model are also explored for the detection using the support vector machine, logistic regression and K-nearest neighbor classifiers. Moreover, a classifier fusion strategy is also proposed that fuses the predictions from the different classifiers via majority voting. Experimental results reveal that via using learned image features and classification fusion strategy, the recall, and F1-score have improvised to 99.20% and 99.40%.},

The recognition of visual symptoms is difficult and can take longer time by radiologists as CXR provides various signs of viral infection. Therefore, artificial intelligence-based method for automated identification of COVID by utilizing X-ray images has been found to be very promising. In the era of deep learning, effective utilization of existing pretrained generalized models is playing a decisive role in terms of time and accuracy. In this paper, the benefits of weights of existing pretrained model VGG16 and InceptionV3 have been taken. Base model has been created using pretrained models (VGG16 and InceptionV3). The last fully connected (FC) layer has been added as per the number of classes for classification of CXR in binary and multi-class classification by appropriately using transfer learning. Finally, combination of layers is made by integrating the FC layer weights of both the models (VGG16 and InceptionV3). The image dataset used for experimentation consists of healthy, COVID, pneumonia viral, and pneumonia bacterial.

The proposed approach is built on the widely adopted technology roadmapping framework and customizes its context, architecture, and process by synthesizing data science, big data, and data-driven organization literature. Based on industry collaborations, the framework provides a hybrid and agile methodology comprising the recommended steps. We applied DSR with a research group with sector experience to create a comprehensive data science roadmap to validate and refine the framework. The results indicate that the framework facilitates DSR initiatives by creating a comprehensive roadmap capturing strategy, data, technology, and organizational perspectives. The contemporary literature illustrates prebuilt roadmaps to help businesses become data-driven. However, becoming data-driven also necessitates significant social change toward openness and trust. The DSR initiative can facilitate this social change by opening communication channels, aligning perspectives, and generating consensus among stakeholders.},

Despite rapid digital transformation of primary care practices, digital health interventions (DHIs) in preventive care have yet to be systematically evaluated. Objective: This review aimed to identify and describe the scope and use of current DHIs for preventive care in primary care settings. Methods: A scoping review to identify literature published from 2014 to 2020 was conducted across multiple databases using keywords and Medical Subject Headings terms covering primary care professionals, prevention and care management, and digital health. A subgroup analysis identified relevant studies conducted in US primary care settings, excluding DHIs that use the electronic health record (EHR) as a retrospective data capture tool. Technology descriptions, outcomes (eg, health care performance and implementation science), and study quality as per Oxford levels of evidence were abstracted. Results: The search yielded 5274 citations, of which 1060 full-text articles were identified. Following a subgroup analysis, 241 articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies primarily examined DHIs among health information technologies, including EHRs (166/241, 68.9%), clinical decision support (88/241, 36.5%), telehealth (88/241, 36.5%), and multiple technologies (154/241, 63.9%). DHIs were predominantly used for tertiary prevention (131/241, 54.4%). Of the core primary care functions, comprehensiveness was addressed most frequently (213/241, 88.4%). DHI users were providers (205/241, 85.1%), patients (111/241, 46.1%), or multiple types (89/241, 36.9%). Reported outcomes were primarily clinical (179/241, 70.1%), and statistically significant improvements were common (192/241, 79.7%). Results were summarized across the following 5 topics for the most novel/distinct DHIs: population-centered, patient-centered, care access expansion, panel-centered (dashboarding), and application-driven DHIs. The quality of the included studies was moderate to low. Conclusions: Preventive DHIs in primary care settings demonstrated meaningful improvements in both clinical and nonclinical outcomes, and across user types; however, adoption and implementation in the US were limited primarily to EHR platforms, and users were mainly clinicians receiving alerts regarding care management for their patients. Evaluations of negative results, effects on health disparities, and many other gaps remain to be explored.},

The recent works significantly improved the deep learning-based attacks from various perspectives, like hyperparameter tuning, design guidelines, or custom neural network architecture elements. Still, insufficient attention has been given to the core of the learning process - the loss function.This paper analyzes the limitations of the existing loss functions and then proposes a novel side-channel analysis-optimized loss function: Focal Loss Ratio (FLR), to cope with the identified drawbacks observed in other loss functions. To validate our design, we 1) conduct a thorough experimental study considering various scenarios (datasets, leakage models, neural network architectures) and 2) compare with other loss functions used in the deep learning-based side-channel analysis (both “traditional” ones and those designed for side-channel analysis). Our results show that FLR loss outperforms other loss functions in various conditions while not having computational overhead like some recent loss function proposals.},

With the innovation of smart Multiple Sensorial Media (MulSeMedia) systems, the cloud, and things technologies, “smart health care” is receiving considerable attention from health care communities, industry, government, and academia. The purpose of the present research has been to establish the AI-driven IoT (AIIoT) security and privacy issues and recommend the manner in which all such matters can be adequately addressed. The study employed a qualitative study design in which qualitative information was collected from existing relevant secondary sources. The evidence from the findings shows that the evolution of AI-driven IoT (AIIoT) has added to the significant number of new sensors and devices to the internet, creating an assortment of security and privacy concerns among the users. The study recommends that the current requirement for the AI-driven IoT (AIIoT) is to have certain types of well-defined architecture standards that include interfaces and data models that ensure that the privacy and security of the users are enhanced.},

   abstract = {The dilemma between health concerns and the economy is apparent in the context of strategic decision making during the pandemic. In particular, estimating the patient numbers and achieving an informed management of the dilemma are crucial in terms of the strategic decisions to be taken. The Covid-19 pandemic presents an important case in this context. Sustaining the efforts to cope with and to put an end to this pandemic requires investigation of the spread and infection mechanisms of the disease, and the factors which facilitate its spread. Covid-19 symptoms culminating in respiratory failure are known to cause death. Since air quality is one of the most significant factors in the progression of lung and respiratory diseases, it is aimed to estimate the number of Covid-19 patients corresponding to the pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOX, NO2, CO, O3) after determining the relationship between air pollutant parameters and Covid-19 patient numbers in Turkey. For this purpose, artificial neural network was used to estimate the number of Covid-19 patients corresponding to air pollutant parameters in Turkey. To obtain highest accuracy levels in terms of network architecture structure, various network structures were tested. The optimal performance level was developed with 15 neurons combined with one hidden layer, which achieved a network performance level as high as 0.97342. It was concluded that Covid-19 disease is affected from air pollutant parameters and the number of patients can be estimated depending on these parameters by this study. Since it is known that the struggle against the pandemic should be handled in all aspects, the result of the study will contribute to the establishment of environmental decisions and precautions.},

This pandemic was the main motivation of this survey to deliver and discuss the current image data augmentation techniques which can be used to increase the number of images. In this paper, a survey of data augmentation for digital images in deep learning will be presented. The study begins and with the introduction section, which reflects the importance of data augmentation in general. The classical image data augmentation taxonomy and photometric transformation will be presented in the second section. The third section will illustrate the deep learning image data augmentation.

   abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is increasingly replacing the traditional healthcare systems. However, less focus has been paid to their security against cyber-threats in the implementation of the IoMT and its networks. One of the key reasons can be the challenging task of optimizing typical security solutions to the IoMT networks. And despite the rising admiration of machine learning and deep learning methods in the cyber-security domain (e.g., a threat detection system), most of these methods are acknowledged as a black-box model. The explainable AI (XAI) has become progressively vital to understand the employed learning models to improve trust level and empower security experts to interpret the prediction decisions. The authors propose a highly efficient model named XSRU-IoMT, for effective and timely detection of sophisticated attack vectors in IoMT networks. The proposed model is developed using novel bidirectional simple recurrent units (SRU) using the phenomenon of skip connections to eradicate the vanishing gradient problem and achieve a fast training process in recurrent networks. We also explore the concepts of XAI to improve trust level by providing explanations of the predictive decisions and enabling humans and security experts to understand the causal reasoning and underlying data evidence. The evaluation results on the ToN_IoT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed XSRU-IoMT model as compared to the state-of-the-art compelling detection models, suggesting its usefulness as a viable deployment model in real-IoMT networks.},

The coronavirus went on to be a life-threatening infection and is still wreaking havoc all around the globe. Though vaccines have been rolled out, a section of the population (the elderly and people with comorbidities) still succumb to this deadly illness. Hence, it is imperative to diagnose this infection early to prevent a potential severe prognosis. This contagious disease is usually diagnosed using a conventional technique called the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). However, this procedure leads to a number of wrong and false-negative results. Moreover, it might also not diagnose the newer variants of this mutating virus. Artificial Intelligence has been one of the most widely discussed topics in recent years. It is widely used to tackle various issues across multiple domains in the modern world. In this extensive review, the applications of Artificial Intelligence in the detection of coronavirus using modalities such as CT-Scans, X-rays, Cough sounds, MRIs, ultrasound and clinical markers are explored in depth. This review also provides data enthusiasts and the broader health community with a complete assessment of the current state-of-the-art approaches in diagnosing COVID-19.

In this paper, we develop the variational Bayesian skyline (VBSKY), a method for fitting Bayesian phylodynamic models to very large pathogen genetic data sets. By combining recent advances in phylodynamic modeling, scalable Bayesian inference and differentiable programming, along with a few tailored heuristics, VBSKY is capable of analyzing thousands of genomes in a few minutes, providing accurate estimates of epidemiologically relevant quantities such as the effective reproduction number and overall sampling effort through time.

Since luxury hotel properties have different operation strategies than limited-service hotels, their operational efficiency should be a reference during strategic decision-making processes. Primary research purpose is to identify the most efficient operation model for luxury hotel properties. The study computed operation efficiency scores using the data envelopment analysis approach to rank the property efficiency of 37 fully equipped luxury hotels in the United States. Each property can utilize slack analysis to discover a strategic benchmarking company (best efficient frontier) and intuitive strategic recommendations and gain superior input and output productivity. Tobit model analysis provides supplemental understandings regarding the additional operational factors impacting luxury hotel properties’ efficiency score variations. Operating efficiency was found to be achieved by multiple operating inputs and influenced by relative price, fixed costs, and management systems. Theoretical comprehensiveness of luxury service mix has been empirically tested by highlighting efficiency as a key measure. In addition, RevPAR’s ratio on TRevPAR further highlights the importance for luxury hotels to increase non-room sales and revenues to accomplish efficiency.},

These effects are statistically reflected in flight operational data, which are indirectly constrained by air transportation management as well as aircraft design. In this research, we develop a data-enhanced methodology for modeling dynamic flight simulations of aircraft to enable accurate estimation of performance parameters. The relevant flight phases and constraints of these simulations are determined by employing supervised machine learning on the flight data. The methodology is demonstrated by simulating flights across representative short-, medium-, and long-haul sectors using data shared by our airline partner. We compare the fuel burn and flight time calculation results with those from the Bréguet range and endurance equations, from an available open-source flight performance model, and from the reference data for validation. The developed dynamic flight simulation model is designed in such a way to enable accurate flight performance analysis even when high-fidelity force analyses and control models are absent, which is common in preliminary design frameworks. This will further enable incorporating flight data into aircraft design processes.},

   abstract = {Background: Falls may cause elderly people to be bedridden, requiring professional intervention; thus, fall prevention is crucial. The use of electronic health records (EHRs) is expected to provide highly accurate risk assessment and length-of-stay data related to falls, which may be used to estimate the costs and benefits of prevention. However, no studies to date have investigated the extent to which hospital stays could be shortened through fall avoidance resulting from the use of prediction tools. Objective: We first estimated the extended length of hospital stay caused by falls among elderly inpatients. Next, we developed a model that predicts falls using clinical text as input and evaluated its accuracy. Finally, we estimated the potentially shortened hospital stay that would be made possible by appropriate interventions based on the prediction model. Methods: Patients aged 65 years or older were selected as subjects, and the EHRs of 1728 falls and 70,586 nonfalls were subjected to analysis. The extended-stay lengths were estimated using propensity score matching of 49 associated variables. Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers and bidirectional long short-term memory methods were used to predict falls from clinical text. The estimated length of stay and the outputs of the prediction model were used to determine stay reductions. Results: The extended length of hospital stay due to falls was estimated to be 17.8 days (95% CI 16.6-19.0), which dropped to 8.6 days when there were unobserved covariates at an odds ratio of 2.0. The accuracy of the prediction model was as follows: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.851; F-value, 0.165; recall, 0.737; precision, 0.093; and specificity, 0.839. When assuming interventions with 25% or 100% effectiveness against cases where the model predicted a fall, the stay reduction was estimated at 0.022 and 0.099 days/day, respectively. Conclusions: The accuracy of the prediction model using clinical text is considered to be higher than the prediction accuracy of conventional assessments. However, our model's precision remained low at 9.3%. This may be due, in part, to the inclusion of cases in which falls did not occur because of preventative interventions during hospitalization. Nonetheless, it is estimated that interventions for cases when falls were predicted will reduce medical costs by 886 Yen/day (US $6.50/day) of intervention, even if the preventative effect is 25%. Limitations include the fact that these results cannot be extrapolated to short- or long-term hospitalization cases, and that this was a single-center study.},

We systematically searched eight interdisciplinary databases including MEDLINE-Ovid, ERIC, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science: Core Collection, Compendex, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Databases were searched from inception until the date of search on April 13, 2021. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We only examined original, peer-reviewed interventional studies that self-described as AI interventions, focused on medical education, and were relevant to surgical trainees (defined as medical or dental students, postgraduate residents, or surgical fellows) within the title and abstract (see Table 2). Animal, cadaveric, and in vivo studies were not eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: After systematically searching eight databases and 4255 citations, our scoping review identified 49 studies relevant to artificial intelligence in surgical education. We found diverse interventions related to the evaluation of surgical competency, personalization of surgical education, and improvement of surgical education materials across surgical specialties. Many studies used existing surgical education materials, such as the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills framework or the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set database. Though most studies did not provide outcomes related to the implementation in medical schools (such as cost-effective analyses or trainee feedback), there are numerous promising interventions. In particular, many studies noted high accuracy in the objective characterization of surgical skill sets. These interventions could be further used to identify at-risk surgical trainees or evaluate teaching methods. CONCLUSIONS: There are promising applications for AI in surgical education, particularly for the assessment of surgical competencies, though further evidence is needed regarding implementation and applicability.},

There is an urgent need for clinically valuable and generalizable triage tools assisting the allocation of hospital resources, particularly in resource-limited countries. We developed and validate CODOP, a machine learning-based tool for predicting the clinical outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. CODOP was trained, tested and validated with six cohorts encompassing 29223 COVID-19 patients from more than 150 hospitals in Spain, the USA and Latin America during 2020–22. CODOP uses 12 clinical parameters commonly measured at hospital admission for reaching high discriminative ability up to 9 days before clinical resolution (AUROC: 0·90–0·96), it is well calibrated, and it enables an effective dynamic risk stratification during hospitalization. Furthermore, CODOP maintains its predictive ability independently of the virus variant and the vaccination status. To reckon with the fluctuating pressure levels in hospitals during the pandemic, we offer two online CODOP calculators, suited for undertriage or overtriage scenarios, validated with a cohort of patients from 42 hospitals in three Latin American countries (78–100% sensitivity and 89–97% specificity). The performance of CODOP in heterogeneous and geographically disperse patient cohorts and the easiness of use strongly suggest its clinical utility, particularly in resource-limited countries.</p>},

   abstract = {We have come a long way since the start of the COVID-19 pandemicÑfrom hoarding toilet paper and wiping down groceries to sending our children back to school and vaccinating billions. Over this period, the global community of epidemiologists and evolutionary biologists has also come a long way in understanding the complex and changing dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. In this Review, we retrace our steps through the questions that this community faced as the pandemic unfolded. We focus on the key roles that mathematical modeling and quantitative analyses of empirical data have played in allowing us to address these questions and ultimately to better understand and control the pandemic.

   abstract = {The World Health Organization defines health promotion as process of enabling people to increase control over their health and its determinants, and thereby improve their health. As the world transitions into the information age, incorporating digital technologies into health promotion is becoming commonplace. This article discusses current applications of digital health promotion (DHP) and addresses its potential benefits, challenges, as well as how differences in cultures, governance models and digital readiness across the globe will shape the implementation of DHP differently in each society. The benefits include expanding access to health information and health promoting services, lowering scaling up costs, personalizing health advice and real-time 'nudging' toward healthier options. Key challenges would involve privacy control, appropriate use of data including secondary usage beyond the original intention, defining the limits of 'nudging' and the right of free choice, and ensuring widespread accessibility and affordability to minimize the exacerbation of social inequities. Finally, we discuss the enabling factors for successful DHP implementation, suggesting measures that should be taken at both individual and system levels. At the individual level, we explore the factors necessary to access and benefit from DHP meaningfully; at the system level, we examine the infrastructure required to provide wide access, establish trust among users and enable sustainability of behavioral changes.},

   abstract = {Increasing amounts of freely available data both in textual and relational form offers exploration of richer document representations, potentially improving the model performance and robustness. An emerging problem in the modern era is fake news detection—many easily available pieces of information are not necessarily factually correct, and can lead to wrong conclusions or are used for manipulation. In this work we explore how different document representations, ranging from simple symbolic bag-of-words, to contextual, neural language model-based ones can be used for efficient fake news identification. One of the key contributions is a set of novel document representation learning methods based solely on knowledge graphs, i.e., extensive collections of (grounded) subject-predicate-object triplets. We demonstrate that knowledge graph-based representations already achieve competitive performance to conventionally accepted representation learners. Furthermore, when combined with existing, contextual representations, knowledge graph-based document representations can achieve state-of-the-art performance. To our knowledge this is the first larger-scale evaluation of how knowledge graph-based representations can be systematically incorporated into the process of fake news classification.},

   abstract = {Identifying objective and reliable markers to tailor diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric patients remains a challenge, as conditions like major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia are qualified by complex behavior observations or subjective self-reports instead of easily measurable somatic features. Recent progress in computer vision, speech processing and machine learning has enabled detailed and objective characterization of human behavior in social interactions. However, the application of these technologies to personalized psychiatry is limited due to the lack of sufficiently large corpora that combine multi-modal measurements with longitudinal assessments of patients covering more than a single disorder. To close this gap, we introduce Mephesto, a multi-centre, multi-disorder longitudinal corpus creation effort designed to develop and validate novel multi-modal markers for psychiatric conditions. Mephesto will consist of multi-modal audio-, video-, and physiological recordings as well as clinical assessments of psychiatric patients covering a six-week main study period as well as several follow-up recordings spread across twelve months. We outline the rationale and study protocol and introduce four cardinal use cases that will build the foundation of a new state of the art in personalized treatment strategies for psychiatric disorders.},

   abstract = {Recent events have forced building managers to examine energy use during vacant periods and revealed miscellaneous electrical loads (MELs) as an opportunity for savings. This paper addresses a key step in unlocking these savings, specifically the reliable identification of when a building is vacant. A Vacancy Inference Engine (VIE), using sensor fusion, was developed to identify vacant periods based on outputs from common sensors, historical building vacancy patterns, and expert knowledge. The VIE calculates the confidence that a building is vacant, allowing building managers to balance the capture of energy savings with the possibility of complaints due to powering down MELs. The VIE has the advantage over logistic regression and other models in that it does not require a full set of ground truth for the training process. The VIE successfully predicted vacancy in an office building using input data streams of instantaneous electricity demand, indoor carbon dioxide concentrations, and the number of active Wi-Fi connections. The VIE's ability to predict vacancy was compared to that of logistic regression using a metric based on the Complaint Opportunity Rate and found to be nearly identical (0.94 versus 0.95, respectively).},

   abstract = {Digitalisation is transforming the railway globally. One of the major considerations in digital transformation of any industry including the railway is the increased exposure to cyberattacks. The railway industry is vulnerable to these attacks because since the number of digital items and also number of interfaces between digital and physical components in the railway systems keep increasing. Increased number of items and interfaces require new frameworks, concepts and architectures to ensure the railway system’s resilience with respect to cybersecurity challenges, such as lack of proactiveness, lack of holistic perspective and obsolescence of safety systems exposed to current and future cyber threats landscape. To this date, there are several works carried out in the literature that studied the cybersecurity aspects and its application on railway infrastructure. However, to develop and implement an appropriate roadmap to cybersecurity in railways, there is a need of describing emerging challenges, and approaches to deal with these challenges and the possibilities and benefits of these. Hence, the objective of this paper is to provide a systematic review and outline cybersecurity emerging trends and approaches, and also to identify possible solutions by querying literature, academic and industrial, for future directions. The authors of this paper conducted separate searches through four popular databases, that is, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science and IEEE explore. For the screening process, authors have used keywords with Boolean operators and database filters and identified 90 articles most relevant to the study domain. The analysis of 90 articles shows that majority of the cybersecurity studies lies within the railways are conceptual and lags in application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based security. Like other industries, it is very important that railways should also follow latest security technologies, trends and train their workforce for cyber hygiene since railways are already in digitalization transition mode.},

In this paper, we propose an inductive framework to develop more gender-balanced knowledge batteries by including political issues that are of particular relevance to women and women’s lives. Employing gender-balanced measures of political knowledge reveal instances where women and men demonstrate equivalent levels of political knowledge and higher levels of political interest and efficacy among women—engagement that is often masked by conventional measures of knowledge.},

In this study, we analyze a data-driven COVID-19 testing program implemented at a mid-sized university, which utilized two simple, diverse, and easily interpretable machine learning models to predict which students were at elevated risk and should be tested. The program produced a positivity rate of 0.53% (95% CI 0.34–0.77%) from 20,862 tests, with 1.49% (95% CI 1.15–1.89%) of students testing positive within five days of the initial test—a significant increase from the general surveillance baseline, which produced a positivity rate of 0.37% (95% CI 0.28–0.47%) with 0.67% (95% CI 0.55–0.81%) testing positive within five days. Close contacts who were predicted by the data-driven models were tested much more quickly on average (0.94 days from reported exposure; 95% CI 0.78–1.11) than those who were manually contact traced (1.92 days; 95% CI 1.81–2.02). We further discuss how other universities, business, and organizations could adopt similar strategies to help quickly identify positive cases and reduce community transmission.},

Epidemiological parameters such as contagiousness (virus transmission rate), initial number of infected people, and probability of being tested depend on the region's demographic and geographical features, the containment measures introduced; they are calibrated to data about COVID-19 spread in the region of interest. At the first stage of our study, epidemiological data (numbers of people tested, diagnoses, critical cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) for each of the mentioned regions were analyzed. The data were characterized in terms of seasonality, stationarity, and dependency spaces, and were extrapolated using machine learning techniques to specify unknown epidemiological parameters of the model. At the second stage, the Optuna optimizer based on the tree Parzen estimation method for objective function minimization was applied to determine the model's unknown parameters. The model was validated with the historical data of 2020. The modeled results of COVID-19 spread in New York State and the UK have demonstrated that if the level of testing and containment measures is preserved, the number of positive cases in New York State remain the same during March of 2021, while in the UK it will reduce.},

   abstract = {Purpose: A growing number of studies have examined whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems can support imaging-based diagnosis of COVID-19-caused pneumonia, including both gains in diagnostic performance and speed. However, what is currently missing is a combined appreciation of studies comparing human readers and AI. Methods: We followed PRISMA-DTA guidelines for our systematic review, searching EMBASE, PUBMED and Scopus databases. To gain insights into the potential value of AI methods, we focused on studies comparing the performance of human readers versus AI models or versus AI-supported human readings. Results: Our search identified 1270 studies, of which 12 fulfilled specific selection criteria. Concerning diagnostic performance, in testing datasets reported sensitivity was 42–100% (human readers, n = 9 studies), 60–95% (AI systems, n = 10) and 81–98% (AI-supported readers, n = 3), whilst reported specificity was 26–100% (human readers, n = 8), 61–96% (AI systems, n = 10) and 78–99% (AI-supported readings, n = 2). One study highlighted the potential of AI-supported readings for the assessment of lung lesion burden changes, whilst two studies indicated potential time savings for detection with AI. Conclusions: Our review indicates that AI systems or AI-supported human readings show less performance variability (interquartile range) in general, and may support the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia from other forms of pneumonia when used in high-prevalence and symptomatic populations. However, inconsistencies related to study design, reporting of data, areas of risk of bias, as well as limitations of statistical analyses complicate clear conclusions. We therefore support efforts for developing critical elements of study design when assessing the value of AI for diagnostic imaging.},

   abstract = {The transition to remote work brings uncertainty to the future power consumption pattern. The COVID mandates in 2020 have accelerated the transition to remote work, generating major uncertainty regarding how residential power consumption patterns will shift. Understanding these shifts is vital for regional operators who will need to implement long-term planning strategies if companies continue to adopt remote work practices. Additionally, if new COVID variants prompt extended stay-at-home mandates, the resulting behavior shifts will decide the optimal combination of power generation in a region. Our study examines changes in hourly residential power consumption patterns resulting from COVID mandates in Arizona. We estimate how the COVID mandates and subsequent remote work practices could change the power consumption patterns using individual-consumer-level hourly power consumption data for 6,309 consumers and a machine learning framework. We also simulate how the hourly power consumption pattern will change with increasing penetration of remote work under winter and summer temperature settings. We then use our simulations to test the policy effectiveness of changing time-of-use (TOU) rates. Our results show that COVID mandates likely increase the power consumption in the afternoon by 13%, and can change the power consumption pattern in winter from a two-peaked shape to a one-peaked shape. Furthermore, we show that the residents' income, race, and house size are significantly correlated with the changes in power consumption, and the correlation is not linear. We find that, by increasing the peak hour prices and decreasing the off-peak hour prices by 10% of the TOU pricing, the peak electricity demand could be reduced by 10%. Our results show under the new remote work era: (1) the need for modifying previous energy generation combination planning due to changing peak demand hours; (2) equity concerns regarding TOU pricing and the inability of vulnerable groups to shift electricity consumption; (3) the ability of governments and utilities to lower the maximum load of power consumption by modifying the TOU rates.},

   abstract = {Pediatric Pulmonologists might be asked to consult in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Thus, they should be aware of the recent trends in Neonatology, as reflected in the published literature in the field of Neonatal Pulmonology. A few large trials assessed the influence of prenatal steroids on the rate and the respiratory morbidity associated with TTN in late preterm and term infants. The most recent large multicenter, randomized trial, explored prenatal betamethasone treatment at 34 to 36 weeks of gestation.1 The primary outcome of the study was the composite of treatment in the first 72 hours (the use of continuous positive airway pressure or high‐flow nasal cannula for at least 2 hours, supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen of at least 0.30 for at least 4 hours, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mechanical ventilation) or stillbirth or neonatal death within 72 hours after delivery. The rate of primary outcome was lower in the betamethasone group compared to the placebo group (11.6% vs. 14.4%, p = 0.02), and the rate of severe respiratory complications was also lower in the betamethasone group (8.1% vs. 12.1%, p < 0.001). The rate of RDS, apnea and pneumonia were similar in the two groups, but rate of TTN was significantly lower in the study group (6.7% vs. 9.9%, p = 0.002). There was also a reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), resuscitation at birth and surfactant use in the betamethasone group. While there are contradictory studies, this trial may support the role of steroids in the prevention of TTN in late preterm infants. Currently, there are no clinical trials that examined the effect of postnatal corticosteroids on TTN in late preterm and term infants. The use of early systemic steroids in extremely preterm infants is not recommended because they may compromise brain development. In the Neurosis study,2 863 infants (gestational age, 23 weeks 0 days to 27 weeks 6 days) were randomly assigned to early (within 24 hours after birth) inhaled budesonide or placebo until they no longer required oxygen and positive‐pressure support or until they reached a postmenstrual age of 32 weeks 0 days. The primary outcome was death or BPD. This study concluded that among extremely preterm infants, the incidence of BPD was lower among those who received early inhaled budesonide than among those who received placebo, but the advantage may have been gained at the expense of increased mortality. In a recent meta‐analysis, Shinwell et al.3 assessed the safety and efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids for prevention or treatment of BPD or death in preterm infants. Inhaled corticosteroids were associated with a significant reduction in death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (risk ratio [RR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 0.99, I2 = 0%, P =.03; 6 trials, n = 1285). BPD was significantly reduced (RR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91, I2 = 0%, 7 trials, n = 1168). The use of systemic steroids was significantly reduced in the treated infants. They concluded that very preterm infants appear to benefit from inhaled corticosteroids with reduced risk for BPD and no effect on death, other morbidities or adverse events. Data on long‐term respiratory, growth, and developmental outcomes are eagerly awaited. The role of inhaled corticosteroids in established BPD in spontaneously breathing infants was studied by Kugelman et al.4 They administered the inhaled steroid hydrofluoalkane‐beclomethasone dipropionate (QVAR) that is unique in its small particle size resulting in higher lung deposition. This was a double‐blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, multicenter pilot study. The study was unable to detect a significant effect of inhaled QVAR on the respiratory course of established BPD. The study was under powered. Possible benefits of QVAR could be masked by a tendency towards higher use of additional steroids in the placebo group. Despite the near universal adaptation of gentle mechanical ventilation, surfactant use and non‐invasive respiratory support, BPD remains one of the most common respiratory morbidities in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. A recent meta‐analysis5 reported on the efficacy of intra‐tracheal administration of budesonide‐surfactant mixture in preventing BPD in these infants. The analysis included only 2 studies and revealed that infants who received intra‐tracheal instillation of budesonide‐surfactant mixture demonstrated 43% reduction in the risk of BPD (RR: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.43‐0.76, NNT = 5). Although mortality was not different between the groups, a 40% reduction was observed in the composite outcome of death or BPD in the budesonidesurfactant group (RR: 0.60; 95%CI: 0.49‐0.74, NNT = 3). Thus, this review concludes that intra‐tracheal administration of budesonidesurfactant combination was associated with decreased incidence of BPD alone or composite outcome of death or BPD in VLBW infants. However, there is a need for larger trials before this combination of therapies can be recommended as a standard of care. In line with the trend of minimal invasive therapy, Kugelman et al.6 published a study on the impact of continuous capnography in ventilated neonates: a randomized, multi‐center study. Study aim was to compare the time spent within a pre‐defined safe range of carbondioxide (30‐60 mmHg) during conventional ventilation between infants who were monitored with distal capnography (dETCO2) and those who were not. Infants in the monitored compared with the masked group spent significantly (p = 0.03) less time at unsafe range of dETCO2 levels (high: 3.8 vs. 8.8% or low: 3.8 vs. 8.9%, respectively). Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) rate was lower in the monitored group (p = 0.02) and was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the independent factors: dETCO2‐monitoring and GA. The rate of BPD was comparable between the groups. The study concluded that continuous dETCO2‐ monitoring was found to improve the control of carbon‐dioxide levels within a safe range during conventional ventilation in the NICU. Bradley et al.7 reported that nasal high‐flow therapy (nHFT) is commonly used for non‐invasive respiratory support in the NICU. The study objective was to determine which aspects of neonatal nHFT have achieved adequate evidence base to support consensus among experienced clinical investigators, and to document areas lacking consensus to promote future investigations. Consensus was reached for many aspects of nHFT including: need for adequate heating and humidification, need to prevent nares occlusion, maximum flow rate of 8 L/min, assessment of FiO2 and work of breathing for either flow escalation or weaning, equivalence of nHFT to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) for non‐invasive support of infants>28 weeks with resolving respiratory distress, and use of nHFT for non‐invasive support of stable infants on nCPAP. A majority consensus occurred for initial gas flow rates in the range of 4‐6 liters per minute and for nHFT as primary therapy for mild respiratory distress. There was no consensus on the approach to discontinuing nHFT. The goal of gentle support and minimally invasive respiratory therapy is to improve the long term respiratory and neurological outcome of the very premature infants. A recent study,8 incorporating new modalities of respiratory support revisited the definition of BPD. The objective of that study was to identify the optimal definition of BPD that best predicts respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes in very preterm infants. They concluded that defining BPD by the use of oxygen alone is inadequate because oxygen/respiratory support is a better indicator of chronic respiratory insufficiency. In particular, oxygen/respiratory support at 40 weeks' post menstrual age (PMA) was identified as the best predictor for serious respiratory morbidity, while it also displayed a good ability to predict neurosensory morbidity at 18 to 21 months. To conclude, the trend in modern Neonatology is to be as gentle as possible, and to use new technologies and modes of therapy to achieve this goal.},

   abstract = {Background: Despite the vaccination process in Germany, a large share of the population is still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we face the spread of novel variants. Until we overcome the pandemic, reasonable mitigation and opening strategies are crucial to balance public health and economic interests. Methods: We model the spread of SARS-CoV-2 over the German counties by a graph-SIR-type, metapopulation model with particular focus on commuter testing. We account for political interventions by varying contact reduction values in private and public locations such as homes, schools, workplaces, and other. We consider different levels of lockdown strictness, commuter testing strategies, or the delay of intervention implementation. We conduct numerical simulations to assess the effectiveness of the different intervention strategies after one month. The virus dynamics in the regions (German counties) are initialized randomly with incidences between 75 and 150 weekly new cases per 100,000 inhabitants (red zones) or below (green zones) and consider 25 different initial scenarios of randomly distributed red zones (between 2 and 20% of all counties). To account for uncertainty, we consider an ensemble set of 500 Monte Carlo runs for each scenario. Results: We find that the strength of the lockdown in regions with out of control virus dynamics is most important to avoid the spread into neighboring regions. With very strict lockdowns in red zones, commuter testing rates of twice a week can substantially contribute to the safety of adjacent regions. In contrast, the negative effect of less strict interventions can be overcome by high commuter testing rates. A further key contributor is the potential delay of the intervention implementation. In order to keep the spread of the virus under control, strict regional lockdowns with minimum delay and commuter testing of at least twice a week are advisable. If less strict interventions are in favor, substantially increased testing rates are needed to avoid overall higher infection dynamics. Conclusions: Our results indicate that local containment of outbreaks and maintenance of low overall incidence is possible even in densely populated and highly connected regions such as Germany or Western Europe. While we demonstrate this on data from Germany, similar patterns of mobility likely exist in many countries and our results are, hence, generalizable to a certain extent.},

Combined with widespread user adoption and the ability to gather user data remotely, smartphone-based sensing has become an appealing choice for health research. Numerous studies over the years have demonstrated the promise of using smartphone-based sensing to monitor a range of health conditions, particularly mental health conditions. However, as research is progressing to develop the predictive capabilities of smartphones, it becomes even more crucial to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of using this technology, given its potential impact on human health. To this end, this paper presents a narrative review of smartphone-sensing literature from the past 5 years, to highlight the opportunities and challenges of this approach in healthcare. It provides an overview of the type of health conditions studied, the types of data collected, tools used, and the challenges encountered in using smartphones for healthcare studies, which aims to serve as a guide for researchers wishing to embark on similar research in the future. Our findings highlight the predominance of mental health studies, discuss the opportunities of using standardized sensing approaches and machine-learning advancements, and present the trends of smartphone sensing in healthcare over the years.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on mankind, causing physical suffering and deaths across the globe. Even those who have not contracted the virus have experienced its far-reaching impacts, particularly on their mental health. The increased incidences of psychological problems, anxiety associated with the infection, social restrictions, economic downturn, etc., are likely to aggravate with the virus spread and leave a longer impact on humankind. These reasons in aggregation have raised concerns on mental health and created a need to identify novel precursors of depression and suicidal tendencies during COVID-19. Identifying factors affecting mental health and causing suicidal ideation is of paramount importance for timely intervention and suicide prevention. This study, thus, bridges this gap by utilizing computational intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to unveil the factors underlying mental health issues. We observed that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown anxiety emerged as significant factors leading to poor mental health outcomes after the onset of COVID-19. Consistent with previous works, we found that psychological disorders have remained pre-eminent. Interestingly, financial burden was found to cause suicidal ideation before the pandemic, while it led to higher odds of depressive (non-suicidal) thoughts for individuals who lost their jobs. This study offers significant implications for health policy makers, governments, psychiatric practitioners, and psychologists.},

EDIMA targets early detection of IoT botnets prior to the launch of an attack and includes a novel two-stage Machine Learning (ML)-based detector developed specifically for IoT bot detection at the edge gateway. The ML-based bot detector first employs supervised ML algorithms for aggregate traffic classification and subsequently Autocorrelation Function (ACF)-based tests to detect individual bots. The EDIMA architecture also comprises a malware traffic database, a policy engine, a feature extractor and a traffic parser. Performance evaluation results using our testbed setup with real-world IoT malware traffic as well as other public IoT datasets show that EDIMA achieves high bot scanning and bot-CnC traffic detection accuracies with very low false positive rates. The detection performance is also shown to be robust to an increase in the number of IoT devices connected to the edge gateway where EDIMA is deployed. Further, the runtime performance analysis of a Python implementation of EDIMA deployed on a Raspberry Pi reveals low bot detection delays and low RAM consumption. EDIMA is also shown to outperform existing detection techniques for bot scanning traffic and bot-CnC server communication.},

However, most of the proposed methods struggle with the detection of face masks that are too small an object to detect and further achieve low detection accuracy. Considering the issues of the existing methods, in this work, we have proposed ETL-YOLO v4 with a modified and improved feature extraction and prediction network for tiny YOLO v4 which surpasses all its predecessors and other related work in the literature. To develop ETL-YOLO v4, we have improved the backbone architecture of tiny YOLO v4 by adding a modified-dense SPP network, two additional detection layers with modified and optimized CNN layers that aid in accurate prediction, used Mish as the activation function, and utilized modified anchor boxes. Furthermore, to obtain detection results in images of varied viewpoints, we have added Mosaic and CutMix data augmentation at training time. The proposed ETL-YOLO v4 achieved 9.93% higher mAP, 5.75% higher average precision (AP) for faces with masks, and 16.6% higher average precision (AP) for the face mask region as compared to its original base-line variant.},

Artificial Intelligence-based deep learning models have gained much popularity in the detection of many diseases within the confines of biomedical sciences. In this paper, a deep neural network-based “LiteCovidNet” model is proposed that detects COVID-19 cases as the binary class (COVID-19, Normal) and the multi-class (COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia) bifurcated based on chest X-ray images of the infected persons. An accuracy of 100% and 98.82% is achieved for binary and multi-class classification respectively which is competitive performance as compared to the other recent related studies. Hence, our methodology can be used by health professionals to validate the detection of COVID-19 infected patients at an early stage with convenient cost and better accuracy.},

In this model, the total population is divided into six compartments: the susceptible class, lockdown class, exposed class, asymptomatic infected class, symptomatic infected class, and recovered class. The basic reproduction number (R0) is calculated using the next-generation matrix method and presented graphically based on different progression rates and effective contact rates of infective individuals. The COVID-19 epidemic model exhibits the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium. The local and global stability analysis has been done at the disease-free and endemic equilibrium based on R0. The stability analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable when R0<1, and the endemic equilibrium is locally and globally stable when R0>1 under some conditions. A control strategy including vaccination and treatment has been studied on this pandemic model with an objective functional to minimize. Finally, numerical simulation of the COVID-19 outbreak in India is carried out using MATLAB, highlighting the usefulness of the COVID-19 pandemic model and its mathematical analysis.},

The fast and timely detection of viral infection has proven to be a critical step for deciding the therapeutic outcome in the current COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn not only enhances the patient survival rate but also reduces the disease-associated comorbidities. In the present scenario, rapid, noninvasive detection of the virus using low cost and high throughput microfluidics-based POCT devices embraces the advantages over existing diagnostic technologies, for which a centralized lab facility, expensive instruments, sample pretreatment, and skilled personnel are required. Microfluidic-based multiplexed POCT devices can be a boon for clinical diagnosis in developing countries that lacks a centralized health care system and resources. The microfluidic devices can be used for disease diagnosis and exploited for the development and testing of drug efficacy for disease treatment in model systems. The havoc created by the second wave of COVID-19 led several countries' governments to the back front. The lack of diagnostic kits, medical devices, and human resources created a huge demand for a technology that can be remotely operated with single touch and data that can be analyzed on a phone. Recent advancements in information technology and the use of smartphones led to a paradigm shift in the development of diagnostic devices, which can be explored to deal with the current pandemic situation. This review sheds light on various approaches for the development of cost-effective microfluidics POCT devices. The successfully used microfluidic devices for COVID-19 detection under clinical settings along with their pros and cons have been discussed here. Further, the integration of microfluidic devices with smartphones and wireless network systems using the Internet-of-things will enable readers for manufacturing advanced POCT devices for remote disease management in low resource settings.},

It has had very adverse consequences on people's daily life, healthcare, and the world's economy as well. According to the World Health Organization's most recent statistics, COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic, and the number of infected persons and fatalities growing at an alarming rate. It is highly required to have an effective system to early detect the COVID-19 patients to curb the further spreading of the virus from the affected person. Therefore, to early identify positive cases in patients and to support radiologists in the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray images, a novel method PCA-IELM is proposed based on principal component analysis (PCA) and incremental extreme learning machine. The suggested method's key addition is that it considers the benefits of PCA and the incremental extreme learning machine. Further, our strategy PCA-IELM reduces the input dimension by extracting the most important information from an image. Consequently, the technique can effectively increase the COVID-19 patient prediction performance. In addition to these, PCA-IELM has a faster training speed than a multi-layer neural network. The proposed approach was tested on a COVID-19 patient’s chest X-ray image dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach PCA-IELM outperforms PCA-SVM and PCA-ELM in terms of accuracy (98.11%), precision (96.11%), recall (97.50%), F1-score (98.50%), etc., and training speed.</p>},

   abstract = {In this data-driven era, where a large number of attributes are often publicly available, redundancy becomes a major problem, which leads to large storage and computational resource requirement. Feature selection is a method for reducing the dimensionality of the data by removing such redundant or misleading attributes. This leads to a selection of optimal feature subsets that can be used for further computation like the classification of data. Learning algorithms, when fitted on such optimal subsets of reduced dimensions, perform more efficiently and storing data also becomes easier. However, there exists a trade-off between the number of features selected and the accuracy obtained and the requirement for different tasks may vary. Thus, in this paper, a hybrid filter multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (HFMOEA) has been proposed based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) coupled with filter-based feature ranking methods for population initialization to obtain an optimal trade-off solution set to the problem. The two competing objectives for the algorithm are the minimization of the number of selected features and the maximization of the classification accuracy. The filter ranking methods used for population initialization help in faster convergence of the NSGA-II algorithm to the PF. The proposed HFMOEA method has been evaluated on 18 UCI datasets and 2 deep feature sets (features extracted from image datasets using deep learning models) to justify the viability of the approach with respect to the state-of-the-art.

To improve e-learning and maximise its effectiveness, artificial intelligence (AI) is used to analyse learning data stored in central repositories (e.g. in cloud). However, this approach provides time-lagged feedback and can lead to a violation of user privacy. To overcome these challenges, a new distributed computing paradigm is emerging, known as Edge Computing (EC), which brings computing and data storage closer to where they are required. Combined with AI capabilities, it can reshape the online education by providing real-time assessments of learners to improve their performance while preserving their privacy. Such approach is leading to the convergence of EC and AI and promoting AI at the Edge. However, the main challenge is to maintain the quality of data analysis on devices with limited memory capacity, while preserving user data locally. In this paper, we propose an Edge-AI based approach for distance education that provides a generic operating architecture for an AI unit at the edge and a federated machine learning model to predict at real-time student failure. A real-world scenario of K-12 learners adopting 100% online education is presented to support the proposed approach.},

The overarching espoused aim of blockchain technologies is the decentralization of power over the Internet. Peer-to-peer payments were the first applications, followed by platforms for decentralized applications, decentralized autonomous organizations, and, more recently, self-sovereign identity, decentralized finance, nonfungible tokens, and metaverses. JIT invited Mary Lacity, director of the Blockchain Center of Excellence at the University of Arkansas, to provide an overview of the major innovations, explain how early enterprise adopters are using these innovations, and where these technologies might be headed.

Objectives: This study aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators of implementing early mobilisation (EM) within a trial. Methods: This is a qualitative process evaluation study within the Trial of Early Activity and Mobilisation (TEAM) phase 3 randomised controlled trial. Semistructured interviews were conducted remotely with multiprofessional clinicians (physiotherapists, medical staff, and nursing staff) involved in the delivery of the TEAM intervention at Australian hospitals participating in the TEAM study. Inductive coding was used to establish themes which were categorised into the Behaviour system involving domains of Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation (COM-B), which allowed barriers and enablers affecting EM to be identified. Findings: Semistructured interviews were conducted in three different states of Australia. There were 16 participants, including 10 physiotherapists, five physicians, and one nurse. The key themes that facilitated EM were mentoring, champions, additional staff, organisation of the environment, cultural changes, communication, and documented safety criteria. In contrast, the main factors that hindered EM were lack of expertise and confidence in delivering EM, heavy sedation, interdisciplinary conflicts, and perceived risks related to EM. Conclusion: A wide range of barriers and facilitators that influenced EM within the TEAM study were identified using the COM-B framework. Many of these have been previously identified in the literature; however, participation in the study was viewed positively by multidisciplinary team members.},

These forecasts were found to be informationally efficient over 18 monthly horizons. In addition to boosting with factors, we also studied the advisability of restricting boosting to select the most recent macro variables to capture abrupt structural changes. Since the COVID-19 pandemic upended all government budgets, our boosted forecasts were used to monitor revenues in real-time for the fiscal year 2021. Our estimates showed a drastic year-over-year decline in actual revenues by over 16% in May 2020, followed by several upward nowcast revisions that led to a recovery of −1% in March 2021, which was close to the actual annual value of −1.6%.},

Just Online learning does not fulfill all the learning requirements of undergraduate students, therefore, there is a need for the blended learning (BL) method to be adopted in higher educational institutes for the enhancement of students’ learning outcomes. This research paper focuses on the development of an integrated blended learning model and the performance of the model on students’ learning has been predicted using a Bayesian network (BN) classifier. The proposed model is based on the medium impact blend of the Rotation model and the Enriched Virtual Model and applied to undergraduate computing students. The Data Structures and Algorithms course is targeted for the prediction of students’ performance. The findings of the proposed Integrated BL model show that when students properly attend the classroom lectures followed by their associated lab practical in the Rotation Model and follow the online learning activities in the Enriched Virtual Model properly, then their learning outcomes may be increased as predicted using BN method. The proposed model also reports an overall accuracy of 88.5% on the collected data.},

To this day, these tools remain central to our understanding of biomolecular phenomena. In contrast to other fields such as fluid mechanics or meteorology, the observation of molecular motions at the atomic level remains a major experimental challenge. Continuous advances in computer graphics and numerical computation, combined with the emergence of human–computer interaction approaches, led to the methodology of so-called “interactive molecular simulations”, characterized by two main features. First, the possibility to visualize a running simulation in interactive time, that is, compatible with human perception. Second, the possibility to manipulate the simulation interactively by imposing a force, changing a biophysical property, or editing runtime parameters on the fly. Such simulations are still little used in computational biology, where it is more common to run a series of offline simulations and then visualize and analyze the results. However, interactive molecular simulation tools promise to handle time-consuming tasks such as the modeling of particularly complex biomolecular structures more efficiently or to support approaches such as Rational Drug Design with regard to pharmaceutical applications.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Returning universities to full on-campus operations while the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing has been a controversial discussion in many countries. The risk of large outbreaks in dense course settings is contrasted by the benefits of in-person teaching. Transmission risk depends on a range of parameters, such as vaccination coverage and efficacy, number of contacts and adoption of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs). Due to the generalised academic freedom in Europe, many universities are asked to autonomously decide on and implement intervention measures and regulate on-campus operations. In the context of rapidly changing vaccination coverage and parameters of the virus, universities often lack sufficient scientific insight to base these decisions on. METHODS To address this problem, we analyse a calibrated, data-driven agent-based simulation of transmission dynamics of 13,284 students and 1,482 faculty members in a medium-sized European university. We use a co-location network reconstructed from student enrollment data and calibrate transmission risk based on outbreak size distributions in education institutions. We focus on actionable interventions that are part of the already existing decision-making process of universities to provide guidance for concrete policy decisions. RESULTS Here we show that, with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even a reduction to 25% occupancy and universal mask mandates are not enough to prevent large outbreaks given the vaccination coverage of about 85% recently reported for students in Austria. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that controlling the spread of the virus with available vaccines in combination with NPIs is not feasible in the university setting if presence of students and faculty on campus is required.},

This study aims to provide insights on this important topic by analyzing 312 news articles between December 1, 2019, and March 1, 2021, published by global news media, which report hotels’ strategies and tactics to deal with the pandemic. Grounded on chaos theory, behavioral learning theory, and an integrated crisis management model, a global pandemic crisis management framework is developed. Practically, the paper reveals best practices applied by hoteliers to deal with the pandemic (e.g., service transformation, smart marketing, strategic collaboration/alliance, mergers and acquisitions, and digitalization) and suggests ways for hotel services providers to adapt to the “new travel” age.},

   abstract = {<p>During infection, the pathogen’s entry into the host organism, breaching the host immune defense, spread and multiplication are frequently mediated by multiple interactions between the host and pathogen proteins. Systematic studying of host–pathogen interactions (HPIs) is a challenging task for both experimental and computational approaches and is critically dependent on the previously obtained knowledge about these interactions found in the biomedical literature. While several HPI databases exist that manually filter HPI protein–protein interactions from the generic databases and curated experimental interactomic studies, no comprehensive database on HPIs obtained from the biomedical literature is currently available. Here, we introduce a high-throughput literature-mining platform for extracting HPI data that includes the most comprehensive to date collection of HPIs obtained from the PubMed abstracts. Our HPI data portal, PHILM2Web (Pathogen–Host Interactions by Literature Mining on the Web), integrates an automatically generated database of interactions extracted by PHILM, our high-precision HPI literature-mining algorithm. Currently, the database contains 23 581 generic HPIs between 157 host and 403 pathogen organisms from 11 609 abstracts. The interactions were obtained from processing 608 972 PubMed abstracts, each containing mentions of at least one host and one pathogen organisms. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we also utilized PHILM to process 25 796 PubMed abstracts obtained by the same query as the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. This COVID-19 processing batch resulted in 257 HPIs between 19 host and 31 pathogen organisms from 167 abstracts. The access to the entire HPI dataset is available via a searchable PHILM2Web interface; scientists can also download the entire database in bulk for offline processing.</p>},

   abstract = {Background: Real-world data from electronic health records (EHRs) represent a wealth of information for studying the benefits and risks of medical treatment. However, they are limited in scope and should be complemented by information from the patient perspective. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an innovative research infrastructure that combines information from EHRs with patient experiences reported in questionnaires to monitor the risks and benefits of medical treatment. Methods: We focused on the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) in general practice as a use case. To develop the Benefit, Risk, and Impact of Medication Monitor (BRIMM) infrastructure, we first performed a requirement analysis. BRIMM's starting point is routinely recorded general practice EHR data that are sent to the Dutch Nivel Primary Care Database weekly. Patients with OAB were flagged weekly on the basis of diagnoses and prescriptions. They were invited subsequently for participation by their general practitioner (GP), via a trusted third party. Patients received a series of questionnaires on disease status, pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, adverse drug reactions, drug adherence, and quality of life. The questionnaires and a dedicated feedback portal were developed in collaboration with a patient association for pelvic-related diseases, Bekkenbodem4All. Participating patients and GPs received feedback. An expert meeting was organized to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the new research infrastructure. Results: The BRIMM infrastructure was developed and implemented. In the Nivel Primary Care Database, 2933 patients with OAB from 27 general practices were flagged. GPs selected 1636 (55.78%) patients who were eligible for the study, of whom 295 (18.0% of eligible patients) completed the first questionnaire. A total of 288 (97.6%) patients consented to the linkage of their questionnaire data with their EHR data. According to experts, the strengths of the infrastructure were the linkage of patient-reported outcomes with EHR data, comparison of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, flexibility of the infrastructure, and low registration burden for GPs. Methodological weaknesses, such as susceptibility to bias, patient selection, and low participation rates among GPs and patients, were seen as weaknesses and threats. Opportunities represent usefulness for policy makers and health professionals, conditional approval of medication, data linkage to other data sources, and feedback to patients. Conclusions: The BRIMM research infrastructure has the potential to assess the benefits and safety of (medical) treatment in real-life situations using a unique combination of EHRs and patient-reported outcomes. As patient involvement is an important aspect of the treatment process, generating knowledge from clinical and patient perspectives is valuable for health care providers, patients, and policy makers. The developed methodology can easily be applied to other treatments and health problems.},

While many theories that explain the reasons behind the decline in ridership have been proposed, no consensus on the primary causes has been reached. By employing gradient boosting decision tree and counterfactual simulations, we examine the complex relationships between transit ridership and key internal and external factors from 2002 to 2017 in 85 of the largest urbanized areas in the US. Among several contributing factors, the declining cost of driving, measured by the decreasing share of carless households combined with lower gasoline prices, was the salient, most influential factor behind the recent decline. Neighborhood change in high-density neighborhoods also led to a moderate net loss in ridership. The only factor that has been mitigating further decline was an increase in transit services. Had this increase not occurred, loss of ridership would have been more than double the actual loss during the study period.},

The design of the intervention was motivated by a desire to manage the cognitive load of AI learning by spreading the PD program over several weeks and a desire to form and maintain a community of teachers interested in AI education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each week participants spent an hour independently reading selections from an AI book, reviewing AI activities, and viewing videos of other educators teaching the activities, then met online for 1 hour to discuss the materials and brainstorm how they might adapt the materials for their classrooms. The participants in the AI Book Club were 37 middle school educators from 3 US school districts and 5 youth-serving organizations. The teachers are from STEM disciplines as well as Social Studies and Art. Eighty-nine percent were from underrepresented groups in STEM and CS. In this paper we describe the design of the AI Book Club, its implementation, and preliminary findings on teachers' impressions of the AI Book Club as a form of PD, thoughts about teaching AI in classrooms, and interest in continuing the book club model in the upcoming year. We conclude with recommendations for others interested in implementing a book club PD format for AI learning.},

Then, we review the real-world policy use cases and key decisions that were informed by modeling during the pandemic including the role of modeling in informing planning for hospital capacity, isolation and quarantine facilities, and broad public communication. Key lessons are examined through the real-world application of modeling, noting the importance of locally tailored models, the role of a scientific and technical advisory group, and the challenges of communicating technical considerations to a public audience.</p>},

Early evidence from China indicated that patients with cancer, and particularly those who had recently received chemotherapy or surgery, were at increased risk of adverse outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Many registries of cancer patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 emerged during the first wave. We collate the evidence from these national and international studies and focus on the risk factors for patients with solid cancers and the contribution of systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACT—chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted and hormone therapy) to outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Patients with cancer infected with SARS-Cov-2 have a higher probability of death compared with patients without cancer. Common risk factors for mortality following COVID-19 include age, male sex, smoking history, number of comorbidities and poor performance status. Oncological features that may predict for worse outcomes include tumour stage, disease trajectory and lung cancer. Most studies did not identify an association between SACT and adverse outcomes. Recent data suggest that the timing of receipt of SACT may be associated with risk of mortality. Ongoing recruitment to these registries will enable us to provide evidence-based care.},

Specifically, this study reveals social comfort as an underlying mechanism behind digital customers' preference for self-service technology over interpersonal contact. Also, it recognizes that the relational cost of self-service technology is its lack of empathy with customer needs and that the benefit of human contact is a fulfillment of the consumer need for caring. This study further reveals the moderating role of the service provider's persuasive intent that can increase the benefit and reduce the drawback of interpersonal contact.},

   abstract = {During the coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, many universities have adopted online exam proctoring technologies to monitor and control an increasing number of student cheating incidents. Although it looks like a natural and effective solution for a fair assessment of student online learning performance, the authors argue that proctoring technologies are rooted in problematic assumptions about educational fairness and authoritarian pedagogical approaches. The authors have conducted a qualitative case study in a large-sized, top-tier university in South Korea to investigate the negative impacts of adopting proctoring technologies on student subjectivities, pedagogical relationships and educational outcomes, which have not been fully discussed in previous studies. By utilising Foucault's theorisation of disciplinary governmentality, the authors effectively demonstrate that the binary subjectification of students as cheaters and the cheated has degraded the value of student engagement in university education whilst creating more competitive and distrusting relationships amongst students and between students and teachers. Nevertheless, without challenging the unethical consequences of online proctoring technologies or fundamentally unfair social and educational systems, students willingly accept and adopt them as docile bodies, which has led to educational deterioration rather than innovation. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic There is an increasing number of online exam proctoring technologies available with advanced technical features. During the coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, many universities have adopted online exam proctoring technologies with exam-related policies and regulations to stop student cheating behaviours. Previous studies have discussed both advantages and disadvantages of adopting online exam proctoring technologies, including specific ethical concerns. What this paper adds Online exam proctoring technologies are deeply rooted in problematic educational approaches such as teacher-centred knowledge transmission. The adoption of online exam proctoring technologies has produced negative impacts on student subjectivities, pedagogical relationships and educational outcomes. Focusing on student cheating as an individual and interpersonal problem neglects the more fundamental issue of social and educational inequality. Implications for practice and/or policy The negative consequences and damages created by the adoption of online exams and online exam proctoring technologies need to be carefully reflected. The notion of academic fairness needs to be approached with a broader perspective, considering the different social and academic circumstances each student is in. It is essential to critically engage students with the broader conversation about educational fairness to develop them as critical thinkers and future leaders in their chosen fields.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic heavily influenced human life by constricting human social activity. Following the spread of the pandemic, humans did not have a choice but to change their lifestyles. There has been much change in the field of education, which has led to schools hosting online classes as an alternative to face-to-face classes. However, the concentration level is lowered in the online learning class, and the student’s learning rate decreases. We devise a framework for recognizing and estimating students’ concentration levels to help lecturers. Previous studies have a limitation in that they classified attention levels using only discrete states. Due to the partial information from discrete states, the concentration levels could not be recognized well. This research aims to estimate more subtle levels as specified states by using a minimum amount of body movement data. The deep neural network is used to continuously recognize the human concentration model, and the concentration levels can be predicted and estimated by the Kalman filter. Using our framework, we successfully extracted the concentration levels, which can aid lecturers and can be expanded to other areas. To implement the framework, we recruited participants to take online classes. Data were collected and preprocessed using pose points, and an accuracy of 90.62 % was calculated by predicting the concentration level using the framework. Furthermore, the concentration level was approximated based on the Kalman filter. We found that webcams can be used to quantitatively measure student concentration when conducting online classes. Our framework is a great help for instructors to measure concentration levels, which can increase the learning efficiency. As a future work of this study, if emotion data and skin thermal data are comprehensively considered, a student’s concentration level can be measured more precisely.},

   abstract = {With the exponential growth in population and commensurate increased density in urban cities, access to daylight and views to nature is being severely curtailed in buildings. In parallel, increasingly urgent demands to sharply reduce building energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions are being made to mitigate climate change. There are many challenges and performance tradeoffs associated with the building facade (i.e., daylight and view versus solar and glare control); increased prioritization of health and well-being as a fundamental human requirement could adversely affect building energy-efficiency. Given the current state of knowledge on the effects of daylight and view on health and well-being in buildings, we identify critical needs in research, tools and technologies that if satisfied may enable more effective use of daylight and view in buildings within the constraints of climate change. Lack of knowledge regarding the complex causal mechanisms of window views on human factors is a severely limiting factor in forward progress. Current models and methods to derive bidirectional scattering distribution functions (BSDFs) will need to be modified. Developers of energy-efficient window technologies will need more guidance to shape product development. Advanced window technologies and integrated design can enable attainment of both health and well-being and net zero energy goals, but considerable work will be needed to make such options turnkey and broadly available.},

   abstract = {Rising rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) combined with increases in alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and other liver disease have resulted in the need to develop alcohol management strategies at all levels of patient care. For those with pre-existing liver disease, whether ALD or others, attention to alcohol use treatment and abstinence becomes critical to avoiding worsening liver-related consequences. Modalities to help patients reduce or stop alcohol include screening/brief intervention/referral to treatment, various therapeutic modalities including cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy and 12-step facilitation, and alcohol relapse prevention medications. Harm reduction approaches versus total abstinence may be considered, but for those with existing ALD, particularly advanced ALD (cirrhosis or acute alcoholic hepatitis), total abstinence from alcohol is the recommendation, given clear data that ongoing alcohol use worsens mortality and liver-related morbidity. For certain populations, alcohol cessation is even more critically important. For those with hepatitis C or NAFLD, alcohol use accelerates negative liver-related outcomes. In women, alcohol use accelerates liver damage and results in worsened liver-related mortality. Efforts to integrate AUD and liver disease care are urgently needed and can occur at several levels, with establishment of multidisciplinary ALD clinics for fully integrated co-management as an important goal.},

Following Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, but considering low affect and high affect students separately, we developed a system of five categories of video recommendations: 1) Watch new video; 2) Review current topic video with a new tutor; 3) Review segment of current video with current tutor; 4) Review segment of current video with a new tutor; 5) Watch next video in curriculum sequence. The category of recommendation was determined by student scores on a quiz and a sensor-free engagement detection model. New video recommendations (i.e., category 1) were selected based on a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that takes input from an item response theory model. The recommendation system was evaluated in a large field experiment, both before and after school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show evidence of effectiveness of the video recommendation algorithm during the period of normal school operations, but the effect disappears after school closures. Implications for teacher orchestration of technology for normal classroom use and periods of school closure are discussed.},

   abstract = {The application of in silico medicine is constantly growing in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. These technologies allow us to support medical decisions and self-management and reduce, refine, and partially replace real studies of medical technologies. In silico medicine may challenge some key principles: transparency and fairness of data usage; data privacy and protection across platforms and systems; data availability and quality; data integration and interoperability; intellectual property; data sharing; equal accessibility for persons and populations. Several social, ethical, and legal issues may consequently arise from its adoption. In this work, we provide an overview of these issues along with some practical suggestions for their assessment from a health technology assessment perspective. We performed a narrative review with a search on MEDLINE/Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The following key aspects emerge as general reflections with an impact on the operational level: cultural resistance, level of expertise of users, degree of patient involvement, infrastructural requirements, risks for health, respect of several patients’ rights, potential discriminations for access and use of the technology, and intellectual property of innovations. Our analysis shows that several challenges still need to be debated to allow in silico medicine to express all its potential in healthcare processes.},

This article explores imaginations of digital futures in the infrastructure sector through case study research of a global engineering organisation. Drawing on a practice approach, a typology is generated from interviews with engineers and managers to reveal that three broad imaginations compete within the organisation: technodeterminism; technoscepticism; and human-centric, all with utopian and dystopian variants. Clear relationships exist between the diverse imaginary positions taken by employees with their different roles, biographies and levels of the organisational agency. Those with relatively higher levels of agency tended towards technocentric utopianism while those with lower levels of agency displayed a resolutely dystopian version. Conversely, while the outward-facing image of the organisation promotes a utopian imagination of a technologically driven future, those with the very highest levels of the organisational agency remain technosceptic. This means that real change is slow. However, an encouraging manifesto for the future is suggested by those who are innovating NDTS to reimagine alternative infrastructure futures through improved human-centric social outcomes.},

   abstract = {<p>COVID-19 has affected daily life in unprecedented ways, with dramatic changes in mental health, sleep time and level of physical activity. These changes have been especially relevant in the elderly population, with important health-related consequences. In this work, two different sensor technologies were used to quantify the energy expenditure of ageing adults. To this end, a technological platform based on Raspberry Pi 4, as an elaboration unit, was designed and implemented. It integrates an ambient sensor node, a wearable sensor node and a coordinator node that uses the information provided by the two sensor technologies in a combined manner. Ambient and wearable sensors are used for the real-time recognition of four human postures (standing, sitting, bending and lying down), walking activity and for energy expenditure quantification. An important first aim of this work was to realize a platform with a high level of user acceptability. In fact, through the use of two unobtrusive sensors and a low-cost processing unit, the solution is easily accessible and usable in the domestic environment; moreover, it is versatile since it can be used by end-users who accept being monitored by a specific sensor. Another added value of the platform is the ability to abstract from sensing technologies, as the use of human posture and walking activity for energy expenditure quantification enables the integration of a wide set of devices, provided that they can reproduce the same set of features. The obtained results showed the ability of the proposed platform to automatically quantify energy expenditure, both with each sensing technology and with the combined version. Specifically, for posture and walking activity classification, an average accuracy of 93.8% and 93.3% was obtained, respectively, with the wearable and ambient sensor, whereas an improvement of approximately 4% was reached using data fusion. Consequently, the estimated energy expenditure quantification always had a relative error of less than 3.2% for each end-user involved in the experimentation stage, classifying the high level information (postures and walking activities) with the combined version of the platform, justifying the proposed overall architecture from a hardware and software point of view.</p>},

Under the concept of PI, they are transformed into an open logistics network, providing an efficient way to relocate physical goods to a given place in a short period of time. A hyperconnected city logistics system is conceptualized as the final segment of a PI-network. It uses regional and city hubs as the final leg of last-mile delivery. Inventory at PI-hubs has to be managed efficiently so as to maximize the benefits of PI. This paper proposes a digital twin-based inbound synchronization framework to streamline the operations of a PI-hub in a hyperconnected city logistics system. Digital twins and Internet of Things technologies are proposed for data acquisition and virtualization of real conditions of physical objects, followed by machine learning-integrated models to optimize a joint order fulfillment and replenishment operation in the PI-hubs. Adopting the proposed framework can formulate a Total Inbound Synchronization at three levels: order synchronization, process synchronization and information synchronization. Simulation results show a significant reduction of traveling distance in PI-hubs if the interdependent order fulfillment and replenishment operations are considered as a joint operation. In addition, this paper provides practical implications for logistics service providers to manage information flows within a PI-network driven by digital twins.},

   abstract = {Making a specific diagnosis in neurodevelopmental disorders is traditionally based on recognizing clinical features of a distinct syndrome, which guides testing of its possible genetic etiologies. Scalable frameworks for genomic diagnostics, however, have struggled to integrate meaningful measurements of clinical phenotypic features. While standardization has enabled generation and interpretation of genomic data for clinical diagnostics at unprecedented scale, making the equivalent breakthrough for clinical data has proven challenging. However, increasingly clinical features are being recorded using controlled dictionaries with machine readable formats such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), which greatly facilitates their use in the diagnostic space. Improving the tractability of large-scale clinical information will present new opportunities to inform genomic research and diagnostics from a clinical perspective. Here, we describe novel approaches for computational phenotyping to harmonize clinical features, improve data translation through revising domain-specific dictionaries, quantify phenotypic features, and determine clinical relatedness. We demonstrate how these concepts can be applied to longitudinal phenotypic information, which represents a critical element of developmental disorders and pediatric conditions. Finally, we expand our discussion to clinical data derived from electronic medical records, a largely untapped resource of deep clinical information with distinct strengths and weaknesses.},

Herein, we develop a game-theoretic supply chain model to evaluate the impact of government regulations on the shortage of life-saving goods and profit within the supply chain. Our model considers three types of regulation: (i) price regulation in the form of a price cap, (ii) purchase regulation or demand rationing and (iii) a combination thereof. The most distinguishing feature of our model is that it captures consumer panic buying, insufficient capacity, price surges and controls on the supply and demand side of the supply chain that are widely observed during a pandemic. The results establish reasonably simple prescriptions for policymakers to design effective and easy-to-implement regulations to mitigate shortages of critical supplies in the face of a pandemic.},

It has long shouldered the mission of improving air quality and slowing climate warming. However, in recent years, with the acceleration of the energy transition, natural gas has become a major source of carbon emissions in Europe, but before the full coverage of renewable energy, natural gas remains the Europe’s main energy in the short term. In such a complicated background, what is the short-term outlook for the European Union’s (EU) natural gas demand? This paper will answer this question by forecasting the EU’s natural gas consumption. A review of the literature that studies on gas consumption forecasting for the Europe has always been for one country or one region; there is no study for all EU countries, and the forecast periods are mostly for hourly, daily and annual data and no studies for monthly data. In order to fill these two research gaps, this paper forecasts the monthly natural gas consumption from 2021 to 2025 of the top seven gas-consuming countries in the EU and obtains the EU’s total consumption on this basis. In addition, due to the nonlinear seasonal fluctuations in the monthly consumption data of the countries studied, a novel seasonal forecasting model is proposed to better fit this trend, named nonlinear grey Bernoulli model based on Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter (HP-NGBM(1,1)). To demonstrate that HP-NGBM(1,1) model has better predictive ability, this paper uses other seasonal models to make comparative forecasts, and the results show that the HP-NGBM(1,1) model has the smallest error. The forecasting results can provide the reference for the EU’s natural gas consumption market regulation and the formulation of short-term environmental protection strategies and climate change response plannings.},

The life cycle of data at network edge can be described in three stages, and each stage has its own difficulties in edge computing technologies: (1) processing data in edge devices, which can not only make full use of edge resources, but also sharply reduce data transmission burden between edge devices and the faraway cloud centers; (2) in data transmission, it is hard to optimize the transmission routing paths and the optimization can be easily influenced by interferences; (3) after data transmission, the data stored in the cloud centers is not safe forever, and it is necessary to develop effective methods to monitor the status of cloud servers and set accurate anomaly detection alarms and repair destroyed data quickly and entirely. Thus, it is important to develop intelligent approaches to improve the performance of data processing in edge devices, data transmission effectiveness in routing, and anomaly detection and data repair ability in cloud centers.Firstly, we discuss the stage of processing data in edge stages. Main challenges of this stage includes huge data amount to be processed, and limited edge storage and computing resources. Reportedly, monthly global mobile data traffic will be 30.6 exabytes by 2020. Facing the huge amount of IoT data, existed deduplication researches mainly focus on compressing data for each device[42, 118], neglecting making use of duplicates among different IoT devices. In this dissertation, since massive data generated in edge devices tends to have large duplication ratio due to chronological and spatial correlation, we propose a novel system for collaborative Edge-Facilitated Deduplication (EF-dedup) wherein we partition edge nodes into disjoint clusters and perform decentralized deduplication within each cluster, optimizing network cost and storage space trade-off. We evaluate the performance of our system in edge nodes on OpenStack and AWS by using real-world IoT data, demonstrating that EF-dedup achieves much better deduplication throughput than other algorithms.Secondly, we talk about the stage of data transmission. Main challenges of this stage includes how to optimize the data transmission and the interferences in this process. IoT devices include home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, thus the various kinds of IoT devices make it difficult to build stable cooperations among them. Furthermore, the data transmission rate for IoT devices are relatively tiny, varying from250Kbps to 54Mbps, which are the common rates through IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.11, NB-IoT, or ZigBee. The variety and limited transmission rate cause network interferences and bottlenecks. Existed researches focus on estimating network inferences or optimizing network resources on ideally perfect network, but we jointly analyze the influence of different kinds of network inferences on optimizing network resources. In this dissertation, we use Projected Gradient Algorithm(PGA)applied in distributed NUM problem to prove that, under arbitrary, bounded inference errors, distributed traffic optimization algorithms based on the Lagrangian can still converge using running averages of the primal and dual variables. We quantify the optimality gap and validate our theoretic results using extensive NS2 simulations with real world scenarios and showed it worked well in all scenarios.Finally, after data is sent to the data center, it does not mean the data is safe forever, and it is necessary to set accurate anomaly detection for servers in data center and do fast data repair after servers are crashed. For anomaly detection, it is challenging to make precise anomaly predictions by using various kinds of metrics of cloud servers. Existed works only use few metrics to estimate anomaly status for servers in data centers. In this dissertation, we present a machine learning based two-layer system to predict anomaly statuses of cloud servers and launch alarms. We use Amazon CloudWatch service to collect monitoring metrics from Amazon EC2 instances, and use them to predict abnormalities in the future. The first layer is a LSTM(Long short-term memory) network, which is used to predict the future metric vectors. The second layer is to compare the predicted future metrics vectors with current ones, and learn to judge whether abnormalities will appear. The novelty of our design includes that our system could adapt to a much wider range of prediction problems than existed algorithms, and the two-layer structure could extend alarming time and increase prediction accuracy as well. We compare the performance of our proposed system with other popular machine learning algorithms, and the accuracy of our system is much better than others.For data repair, in newly appeared erasure-coded storage systems, it is challenging to optimize the data repair process due to complicated problems includes repair data choices, repair data transmission optimization, and repair task management. Few existed works only consider one or two problems from data selection for repair, data repair deadlines, and bandwidth allocation. In this dissertation, we propose our research on how to repair data efficiently when data is destroyed in erasure-coded storage data centers. We develop an online algorithm to maximize the number of tasks that successfully meet deadlines, under the constraints of data placement, network topology and available bandwidth. The problem is challenging because we need to jointly solve a chunk selection problem that determines the (erasure-coded) chunks used to generate background traffic, a bandwidth allocation problem, and a scheduling problem that schedules tasks with respect to their deadlines. The novelty of our work is our proposed algorithm jointly considers current network topology, source selection and bandwidth constraints. We evaluate our proposed algorithm extensively in both simulation and real experiments in an OpenStack cluster, and demonstrate it has much better performance than other existed algorithms.In conclusion, in this dissertation, we propose various novel models, algorithms and systems to conquer these complicated problems at the same time, prove their theoretical performance, and evaluate the performance in simulations and real-world data and systems. These unique approaches include minimizing storage space, optimizing network resources, network interference analysis, and anomaly prediction, and many of them solve multiple problems simultaneously and even need to balance the conflicts among different tasks. The proposed algorithms and systems are evaluated in both simulations and real-world data and nodes.},

   abstract = {This paper extends frequency domain quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) methods pursuing higher sensitivity to detect Brain Developmental Disorders. Prior qEEG work lacked integration of cross-spectral information omitting important functional connectivity descriptors. Lack of geographical diversity precluded accounting for site-specific variance, increasing qEEG nuisance variance. We ameliorate these weaknesses. (i) Create lifespan Riemannian multinational qEEG norms for cross-spectral tensors. These norms result from the HarMNqEEG project fostered by the Global Brain Consortium. We calculate the norms with data from 9 countries, 12 devices, and 14 studies, including 1564 subjects. Instead of raw data, only anonymized metadata and EEG cross-spectral tensors were shared. After visual and automatic quality control, developmental equations for the mean and standard deviation of qEEG traditional and Riemannian DPs were calculated using additive mixed-effects models. We demonstrate qEEG "batch effects" and provide methods to calculate harmonized z-scores. (ii) We also show that harmonized Riemannian norms produce z-scores with increased diagnostic accuracy predicting brain dysfunction produced by malnutrition in the first year of life and detecting COVID induced brain dysfunction. (iii) We offer open code and data to calculate different individual z-scores from the HarMNqEEG dataset. These results contribute to developing bias-free, low-cost neuroimaging technologies applicable in various health settings.},

   abstract = {Hitherto statistical type inference systems rely thoroughly on supervised learning approaches, which require laborious manual effort to collect and label large amounts of data. Most Turing-complete imperative languages share similar control- and data-flow structures, which make it possible to transfer knowledge learned from one language to another. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual transfer learning framework, PLATO, for statistical type inference, which allows us to leverage prior knowledge learned from the labeled dataset of one language and transfer it to the others, e.g., Python to JavaScript, Java to JavaScript, etc. PLATO is powered by a novel kernelized attention mechanism to constrain the attention scope of the backbone Transformer model such that model is forced to base its prediction on commonly shared features among languages. In addition, we propose the syntax enhancement that augments the learning on the feature overlap among language domains. Furthermore, PLATO can also be used to improve the performance of the conventional supervised-based type inference by introducing cross-language augmentation, which enables the model to learn more general features across multiple languages. We evaluated PLATO under two settings: 1) under the cross-domain scenario that the target language data is not labeled or labeled partially, the results show that PLATO outperforms the state-of-the-art domain transfer techniques by a large margin, , it improves the Python to TypeScript baseline by +14.6%@EM, +18.6%@weighted-F1, and 2) under the conventional monolingual supervised scenario, PLATO improves the Python baseline by +4.10%@EM, +1.90%@weighted-F1 with the introduction of the cross-lingual augmentation.},

   abstract = {Software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications have experienced a decade of explosive growth, eliminating barriers in reaching users and enabling real-time interchanges and intelligence. Using business analytics, SaaS applications are increasingly embedded in the day-to-day activities of businesses and consumers with competition and innovative pricing. Due to the evolution in cloud business models, new issues are surfacing to challenge practitioners and scholars. A number of issues encountered in the practice have not been properly addressed or even recognized. In this paper, we attempt to fill this important gap. We propose a framework of recent business research on SaaS in light of wide adoption of the SaaS business model. This framework broadly classifies SaaS research into two basic themes. For each theme, we review past work that has been instrumental in setting the direction of this line of research and discuss how emerging research opportunities can be addressed. For each research opportunity, we also propose an initial model and the applicable methodology. Further, in order to aid researchers, we identify the data sources wherever applicable, and even present some of the initial results. We conclude by describing promising directions on a roadmap for future research and explain why an integrative perspective of operations, marketing, and information systems is critical to SaaS. In this paper, we bridge the gap between research and practice by identifying the relevant industry problems that would help researchers who are interested in working in this area both to get a starting point and to address important theoretical and practical challenges.},

   abstract = {The rate of decline in the levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) greatly varies among patients who recover from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about factors associated with this phenomenon. The objective of this study is to investigate early factors at admission that can influence long-term NAb levels in patients who recovered from COVID-19. A total of 306 individuals who recovered from COVID-19 at the Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, were included in this study. The patients were classified into two groups with high (NAbhigh, n = 153) and low (NAblow, n = 153) levels of NAb, respectively based on the median NAb levels six months after discharge. The majority (300/306, 98.0%) of the COVID-19 convalescents had detected NAbs. The median NAb concentration was 63.1 (34.7, 108.9) AU/mL. Compared with the NAblow group, a larger proportion of the NAbhigh group received corticosteroids (38.8% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.002) and IVIG therapy (26.5% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.033), and presented with diabetes comorbidity (25.2% vs. 12.2%, p = 0.004); high blood urea (median (IQR): 4.8 (3.7, 6.1) vs. 3.9 (3.5, 5.4) mmol/L; p = 0.017); CRP (31.6 (4.0, 93.7) vs. 16.3 (2.7, 51.4) mg/L; p = 0.027); PCT (0.08 (0.05, 0.17) vs. 0.05 (0.03, 0.09) ng/mL; p = 0.001); SF (838.5 (378.2, 1533.4) vs. 478.5 (222.0, 1133.4) μg/L; p = 0.035); and fibrinogen (5.1 (3.8, 6.4) vs. 4.5 (3.5, 5.7) g/L; p = 0.014) levels, but low SpO2 levels (96.0 (92.0, 98.0) vs. 97.0 (94.0, 98.0) %; p = 0.009). The predictive model based on Gaussian mixture models, displayed an average accuracy of 0.7117 in one of the 8191 formulas, and ROC analysis showed an AUC value of 0.715 (0.657–0.772), and specificity and sensitivity were 72.5% and 67.3%, respectively. In conclusion, we found that several factors at admission can contribute to the high level of NAbs in patients after discharge, and constructed a predictive model for long-term NAb levels, which can provide guidance for clinical treatment and monitoring.},

   abstract = {A joint framework is proposed for the 3D trajectory design of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an flying base station under the time-varying scenarios of users’ mobility and communication request probability changes. The problem of 3D trajectory design is formulated for maximizing the throughput during a UAV’s flying period while satisfying the rate requirement of all ground users (GUEs). Specifically, we consider that GUEs change their positions and communication request probabilities at each time slot; the UAV needs to predict these changes so that it can design its 3D trajectory in advance to achieve the optimization target. In an effort to solve this pertinent problem, an echo state network (ESN) based prediction algorithm is first proposed for predicting the positions and communication request probabilities of GUEs. Based on these predictions, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method is then invoked for finding the optimal deployment locations of UAV in each time slots. The proposed method 1) uses ESN based predictions to represent a part of DRL agent’s state; 2) designs the action and reward for DRL agent to learn the environment and its dynamics; 3) makes optimal strategy under the guidance of a double deep Q network (DDQN). The simulation results show that the UAV can dynamically adjust its trajectory to adapt to time-varying scenarios through our proposed algorithm and throughput gains of about 10.68% are achieved.},

   abstract = {Vaccination is the most effective way to provide long-lasting immunity against viral infection; thus, rapid assessment of vaccine acceptance is a pressing challenge for health authorities. Prior studies have applied survey techniques to investigate vaccine acceptance, but these may be slow and expensive. This study investigates 29 million vaccine-related tweets from August 8, 2020 to April 19, 2021 and proposes a social media-based approach that derives a vaccine acceptance index (VAI) to quantify Twitter users’ opinions on COVID-19 vaccination. This index is calculated based on opinion classifications identified with the aid of natural language processing techniques and provides a quantitative metric to indicate the level of vaccine acceptance across different geographic scales in the U.S. The VAI is easily calculated from the number of positive and negative Tweets posted by a specific users and groups of users, it can be compiled for regions such a counties or states to provide geospatial information, and it can be tracked over time to assess changes in vaccine acceptance as related to trends in the media and politics. At the national level, it showed that the VAI moved from negative to positive in 2020 and maintained steady after January 2021. Through exploratory analysis of state- and county-level data, reliable assessments of VAI against subsequent vaccination rates could be made for counties with at least 30 users. The paper discusses information characteristics that enable consistent estimation of VAI. The findings support the use of social media to understand opinions and to offer a timely and cost-effective way to assess vaccine acceptance.},

   abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM) has been intensively used to support humanitarian aid activities, especially in the Global South. Its data availability in the Global South has been greatly improved via recent humanitarian mapping campaigns. However, large rural areas are still incompletely mapped. The timely provision of map data is often essential for the work of humanitarian actors in the case of disaster preparation or disaster response. Therefore, it has become a vital challenge to boost the speed and efficiency of existing humanitarian mapping workflows. We address this challenge by proposing a novel few-shot transfer learning (FSTL) method to improve the accuracy of OSM missing building detection. We trained two popular object detection models (i.e., Faster R-CNN and SSD) in a training area in Tanzania and transferred the model to target areas in Cameroon and Mozambique. The FSTL method significantly improved the base model performance even with only one training shot. Moreover, we successfully produced a grid-based OSM missing building map (DeepVGI) of 10 m spatial resolution with over 96% overall accuracy (ACC) and 0.85 Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) in both Cameroon and Mozambique. Such maps show great potential to assess and estimate the overall completeness of OSM buildings to support humanitarian mapping activities, especially in places where other (e.g., buildings, roads) datasets are not available.},

   abstract = {In addition to the tremendous loss of life due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic created challenges for the energy system, as strict confinement measures such as lockdown and social distancing compelled by governments worldwide resulted in a significant reduction in energy demand. In this study, a novel, quantitative and uncomplex method for estimating the energy consumption loss due to the pandemic, which was derived from epidemiological data in the beginning stages, is provided; the method bonds a data-driven prediction (LSTM network) of energy consumption due to COVID-19 to an econometric model (ARDL) so that the long- and short-term impact can be synthesized with adequate statistical validation. The results show that energy loss is statistically correlated with the time-changing effective reproductive number (Rt) of the disease, which can be viewed as quantifying confinement intensity and the severity of the earlier stages of the pandemic. We detected a 1.62% decrease in electricity consumption loss caused by each percent decrease in Rt on average. We verify our method by applying it to Germany and 5 U.S. states with various social features and discuss implications and universality. Our results bridge the knowledge gap between key energy and epidemiological parameters and provide policymakers with a more precise estimate of the pandemic's impact on electricity demand so that strategies can be formulated to minimize losses caused by similar crises.},

   abstract = {Current question answering systems are insufficient when confronting real-life scenarios, as they can hardly be aware of whether a question is answerable given its context. Hence, there is a recent pursuit of unanswerability of a question and its attribution. Attribution of unanswerability requires the system to choose an appropriate cause for an unanswerable question. As the task is sophisticated for even human beings, it is expensive to acquire labeled data, which makes it a low-data regime problem. Moreover, the causes themselves are semantically abstract and complex, and the process of attribution is heavily question- and context-dependent. Thus, a capable model has to carefully appreciate the causes, and then, judiciously contrast the question with its context, in order to cast it into the right cause. In response to the challenges, we present PTAU, which refers to and implements a high-level human reading strategy such that one reads with anticipation. In specific, PTAU leverages the recent prompt-tuning paradigm, and is further enhanced with two innovatively conceived modules: 1) a cause-oriented template module that constructs continuous templates towards certain attributing class in high dimensional vector space; and 2) a semantics-aware label module that exploits label semantics through contrastive learning to render the classes distinguishable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design better enlightens not only the attribution model, but also current question answering models, leading to superior performance.},

   abstract = {A buyer exposed to a stockout may lose goodwill and be less inclined to select the same supplier in his next procurement. Reversely, an in-stock experience may restore the supplier's prospect of being selected in the future. What should the supplier's inventory control policy be in this situation? To address this question, we develop a multiperiod model of a buyer who selects a supplier with a probability that depends on the supplier's rating. This rating reflects the buyer's goodwill towards the supplier based on past service, measured in terms of in-stock/out-of-stock incidents, and is updated by the buyer after each service. The supplier's optimal inventory policy partitions the inventory space in order-up-to and do-not-order intervals for each rating. The optimal decision depends on whether ordering reduces the supplier's risk of being downgraded enough to offset the increase in her ordering and inventory costs. We derive and evaluate bounds on the optimal policy and expose some of its properties. We obtain conditions for the optimality of basestock policies and show that such policies are optimal if there are only two ratings or if the buyer's demand is constant. Using our model, we impute the stockout cost in a newsvendor setting. Numerical experiments suggest that (i) the supplier may benefit from holding more inventory in intermediate than in extreme ratings, and from dealing with a buyer who responds less erratically to service, (ii) basestock policies are efficient, and (iii) using an arbitrary stockout cost in the newsvendor setting can significantly hurt profits.},

   abstract = {Reliable data are essential to obtain adequate simulations for forecasting the dynamics of epidemics. In this context, several political, economic, and social factors may cause inconsistencies in the reported data, which reflect the capacity for realistic simulations and predictions. In the case of COVID-19, for example, such uncertainties are mainly motivated by large-scale underreporting of cases due to reduced testing capacity in some locations. In order to mitigate the effects of noise in the data used to estimate parameters of models, we propose strategies capable of improving the ability to predict the spread of the diseases. Using a compartmental model in a COVID-19 study case, we show that the regularization of data by means of Gaussian process regression can reduce the variability of successive forecasts, improving predictive ability. We also present the advantages of adopting parameters of compartmental models that vary over time, in detriment to the usual approach with constant values.},

   abstract = {Background: Biomarkers, such as leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT), have been commonly used to predict the occurrence of life-threatening bacteremia and provide prognostic information, given the need for prompt intervention. However, such diagnosis methods require much time and money. Therefore, we propose a method with a high prediction capability using machine learning (ML) models based on complete blood count (CBC) and differential leukocyte count (DC) and compare its performance with traditional CRP or PCT biomarker methods and those of models incorporating CRP or PCT biomarkers. Methods: We collected 366,586 daily blood culture (BC) results, of which 350,775 (93.2%), 308,803 (82.1%), and 23,912 (6.4%) cases were issued CBC/DC (CBC/DC group), CRP with CBC/DC (CRP&CBC/DC group), and PCT with CBC/DC (PCT&CBC/DC group), respectively. For the ML methods, conventional logistic regression and random forest models were selected, trained, applied, and validated for each group. Fivefold validation and prediction capability were also evaluated and reported. Results: Overall, the ML methods, such as the random forest model, demonstrated promising performances. When trained with CBC/DC data, it achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.802, which is superior to the prediction conventionally made with CRP/PCT levels (0.699/0.731). Upon evaluating the performance enhanced by incorporating CRP or PCT biomarkers, it reported no substantial AUC increase with the addition of either CRP or PCT to CBC/DC data, which suggests the predicting power and applicability of using only CBC/DC data. Moreover, it showed competitive prognostic capability compared to the PCT test with similar all-cause in-hospital mortality (45.10% vs. 47.40%) and overall median survival time (27 vs. 25 days). Conclusions: The ML models using only CBC/DC data yielded more accurate bacteremia predictions compared to those by methods using CRP and PCT data and reached similar prognostic performance as by PCT data. Thus, such models are potentially complementary and competitive with traditional CRP and PCT biomarkers for conducting and guiding antibiotic usage.},

This work introduces the concept of robust estimation for hierarchical forecast reconciliation methods. We formalize two different robust-based approaches applied to unemployment data from multiple labor force surveys in Brazil. In doing so, we address a significant gap in the modelling and forecasting of unemployment, taking into account the hierarchical structure of the data. To demonstrate the potential and validity of the proposed approaches, we compare their performance with those from traditional and state-of-the-art methods. Overall, the robust approaches show promising forecasting results under multiple settings and through the lens of different evaluation metrics.

Outcomes include information about heterogeneity, correlations and temporal patterns present in sensor data, and show the need of the building field for better acknowledging the quality deficiencies that sensor data have. Our results aid in assessing and improving the quality of sensor-based indoor data utilized in machine learning modelling, in evaluating whether a data set is representative enough to build a model that is robust under changing conditions in the building, and in choosing an appropriate number of sensors per space when building an indoor wireless sensor network.},

The study population comprises 321 samples from 236 healthcare and frontline workers fighting COVID-19 in Vitória de Santo Antão, Brazil. Samples were collected from at least six days of symptoms to more than 100 days. The used immunoenzymatic assays were Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA. The most common gender in SerumCovid is female, while the most common age group is between 30 and 39 years old. However, no statistical differences were observed in either genders or age categories. The most reported symptoms were fatigue, headaches, and myalgia. Still, some subjects presented positive results for IgA after 130 days. Based on a temporal analysis, we have not identified general patterns as subjects presented high and low values of IgA and IgG with different evolution trends. Unexpectedly, for subjects with both serological tests, the outcome of IgA and IgG tests were the same (either positive or negative) for more than 80% of the samples. Therefore, SerumCovid helps better understand how COVID-19 affected healthcare and frontline workers, which increases knowledge about the infection and enables direct prevention actions.},

Heart-rate data was remotely collected using a Fitbit wristband.

Node classification, as a fundamental research problem in attributed networks, has attracted increasing attention among research communities. However, most existing models cannot be directly applied to the data with limited labeled instances (textiti.e., the few-shot scenario). Few-shot node classification on attributed networks is gradually becoming a research hotspot. Although several methods aim to integrate meta-learning with graph neural networks to address this problem, some limitations remain. First, they all assume node representation learning using graph neural networks in homophilic graphs. %Hence, suboptimal performance is obtained when these models are applied to heterophilic graphs. Second, existing models based on meta-learning entirely depend on instance-based statistics. %which in few-shot settings are unavoidably degraded by data noise or outliers. Third, most previous models treat all sampled tasks equally and fail to adapt their uniqueness. %which has a significant impact on the overall performance of the model. To solve the above three limitations, we propose a novel graph Meta -learning framework called G raph learning based on P rototype and S caling &amp; shifting transformation (Meta-GPS ). More specifically, we introduce an efficient method for learning expressive node representations even on heterophilic graphs and propose utilizing a prototype-based approach to initialize parameters in meta-learning. Moreover, we also leverage S^2 (scaling &amp; shifting) transformation to learn effective transferable knowledge from diverse tasks. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, which outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines by up to 13% absolute improvement in terms of related metrics.},

The hyperparameters of DNN have a significant influence on its prediction performance. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) form a heuristic-based approach that provides an opportunity to optimize deep learning models to obtain good performance. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary deep learning model called IPSO-DNN based on DNN for prediction and an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm to optimize the kernel hyperparameters of DNN in a self-adaptive evolutionary way. In the IPSO algorithm, a micro population size setting is introduced to improve the search efficiency of the algorithm, and the generalized opposition-based learning strategy is used to guide the population evolution. In addition, the IPSO algorithm employs a self-adaptive update strategy to prevent premature convergence and then improves the exploitation and exploration parameter optimization performance of DNN. In this paper, we show that the IPSO algorithm provides an efficient approach for tuning the hyperparameters of DNN with saving valuable computational resources. We explore the proposed IPSO-DNN model to predict the effect of social distancing on the spread of COVID-19 based on the social distancing metrics. The preliminary experimental results reveal that the proposed IPSO-DNN model has the least computation cost and yields better prediction accuracy results when compared to the other models. The experiments of the IPSO-DNN model also illustrate that aggressive and extensive social distancing interventions are crucial to help flatten the COVID-19 epidemic curve in the United States.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Workplace violence is internationally recognised as a major concern for the workforce, which entails serious consequences, and research shows that medical residents are more likely than other doctors to experience violence in the workplace. This study first examines the effectiveness of simulation-based medical education, and then simulation-based medical education combined with behavioural economics as interventions in medical residents' perception of, attitude toward, and self-efficacy in coping with violence in the workplace. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used, 190 participants were randomised into three study groups to respectively test the effect of simulation-based medical education only and simulation-based medical education plus behavioural economics interventions, compared with a control group. Data were obtained from structured questionnaires, including (1) a perception of aggression scale, a management of aggression and violence attitude scale, a general self-efficacy scale, and (2) socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: The results show that the scores attained by simulation-based medical education (SBME) and simulation-based medical education combined with behavioural economics (SBME + BE) interventions for perception, attitude, and self-efficacy were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < .01). The SBME + BE group recorded a greater improvement in perception, which could be ascribed to the behavioural economics effect. Furthermore, the higher perception of workplace violence is correlated with single residents and those with more work experience, prior experiences of violence in the workplace, and training related to workplace violence. A higher positive correlation of workplace violence was recorded by female and widowed residents,and a higher level of self-efficacy related to violence in the workplace correlated with male, widowed,and senior (third-year) residents. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes important evidence regarding changes in the perception, attitude, and self-efficacy of subjects following both the SBME + BE and SBME interventions among medical residents in coping with workplace violence, the biggest perception change having been recorded after the SBME + BE intervention, which can be explained by the inclusion of behavioural economics.},

It is unknown whether conventional short-term load forecasting methods based on single-task, single-region, and conventional indicators can accurately capture the load pattern during the COVID-19 and should be carefully studied. In this paper, we make the following contributions: 1) A mobility-optimized load forecasting method based on multi-task learning and long short-term memory network is innovatively proposed to alleviate the impact of the COVID-19 on short-term load forecasting. The incorporation of mobility data and data sharing layers potentially reduces the difficulty of capturing the load patterns and improves the generalization of the load forecasting models. 2) The real public data collected from multiple agencies and companies in the United States and European countries are used to conduct horizontal and vertical tests. These tests prove the failure of the conventional models and methods in the COVID-19 and demonstrate the high accuracy (error mostly less than 1%) and robustness of the proposed model. 3) The Shapley additive explanations technology based on game theory is innovatively introduced to improve the objectivity of the models. It visualizes that mobility indicators are of great help to the accurate load forecasting. Besides, the non-synchronous relationships between the indicators’ correlations and contributions to the load have been proved.},

This study focuses on the risk issues relevant with the adverse events where novel technical systems do not serve as expected. We discuss the unique challenges, define the scope of risk management in healthcare and review the state-of-art research on diverse topics under the framework widely used in risk management. Then, we present a systematic approach to identify the hazards to patients and other asset of interest in the perception, cyber communication, and execution of smart technologies and their operational contexts. We also investigate different methods for scenario, likelihood, and consequence analyses for specifying the risks of adverse events, and categorize the approaches of risk reduction, as the main strategy of treating risks of smart healthcare systems, into four groups of design, operation, organization, and legislation. At the last, the article proposes some research perspectives responding to the developing trend of smart healthcare.},

   abstract = {Dry casks for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) ensure the safe storage of SNF and provide radiation shielding. However, the presence of the thick casks encompassing several layers of steel and concrete makes inspection of the SNF a challenging task. Fast neutron interrogation is a viable method for the nondestructive assay of dry storage casks. In this study, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation-based study associated with a machine-learning-based image reconstruction method to verify the content of SNF dry storage casks. We studied the use of neutron transmission and back-scattered measurements to assess the potential damage to fuel assemblies or fuel pin diversion during transportation of dry casks. We used Geant4 to model a realistic HI-STAR 100 cask, MPC-68 canister and basket, and GE-14 fuel assembly irradiated by a D-T neutron generator. Several bundle diversion scenarios were simulated. The angular distribution of the neutrons scattered by the cask was used to identify the diversions inside the fuel cask. A fuel bundle with at least 75% of its pins removed can be identified with a drop in the back-scattered signature larger than 2σ compared with a fully loaded scenario. We combined an iterative reconstruction algorithm with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain a cross-sectional image of the fuel inside the cask. The proposed imaging approach allows locating the position of a missing fuel bundle with at least 75% of the pins removed when performing tomographic imaging of a canister with an overall scan time of less than two hours, when using a commercial neutron generator with a source strength of 1010 n/s in the 4π solid angle.},

   abstract = {Online education promotes the sharing of learning resources. Knowledge tracing (KT) is aimed at tracking the cognition function of students according to their performance on various exercises at different times and has attracted considerable attention. Existing KT models primarily use bisection representations for the performance and cognitive states of students, thus limiting the application scope of these models and the accuracy of the evaluation of student cognitive performance in learning processes. Therefore, fuzzy Bayesian KT models (namely, FBKT and T2FBKT) are proposed to address continuous score scenarios (e.g., subjective examinations) so that the applicability of KT models may be broadened. Moreover, fine-grained cognitive states can be discerned. In particular, referring to type-2 fuzzy theory, T2FBKT mitigates the model uncertainty of FBKT induced by uncertain parameters. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy KT models.},

   abstract = {Segmentation of infections from CT scans is important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up in tackling the COVID-19. Although the convolutional neural network has great potential to automate the segmentation task, most existing deep learning-based infection segmentation methods require fully annotated ground-truth labels for training, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper proposed a novel weakly supervised segmentation method for COVID-19 infections in CT slices, which only requires scribble supervision and is enhanced with the uncertainty-aware self-ensembling and transformation-consistent techniques. Specifically, to deal with the difficulty caused by the shortage of supervision, an uncertainty-aware mean teacher is incorporated into the scribble-based segmentation method, encouraging the segmentation predictions to be consistent under different perturbations for an input image. This mean teacher model can guide the student model to be trained using information in images without requiring manual annotations. On the other hand, considering the output of the mean teacher contains both correct and unreliable predictions, equally treating each prediction in the teacher model may degrade the performance of the student network. To alleviate this problem, the pixel level uncertainty measure on the predictions of the teacher model is calculated, and then the student model is only guided by reliable predictions from the teacher model. To further regularize the network, a transformation-consistent strategy is also incorporated, which requires the prediction to follow the same transformation if a transform is performed on an input image of the network. The proposed method has been evaluated on two public datasets and one local dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than other weakly supervised methods and achieves similar performance as those fully supervised.},

   abstract = {In this work, we consider the transmissions of structured data such as text over a noisy channel and correlated texts over a broadcast channel. As the separate source-channel coding principle no longer holds in such scenarios, we propose a joint source-channel coding scheme which is based on deep learning architecture. In order to enhance the convergence speed, we adopt the bidirectional gated recurrent unit at the encoder. For the decoder, to improve the recovery quality, we propose the following two types of strategies: (1) After a unidirectional neural network based decoder is used, a generative adversarial network is applied to train the whole joint source-channel coding framework and pointwise mutual information is added to the objective function of beam search process; (2) Rather than using a unidirectional neural network-based decoder, we develop a bidirectional neural network based and bidirectional attention mechanism integrated decoder to utilize past and future information. Experiments under different types of channels show that our schemes are superior to the existing deep learning joint source-channel coding method and in the case of low bit budget, long sentence length and small channel signal to noise ratio, our models are significantly superior to those of separate source-channel coding. In addition, we extend the proposed unidirectional and bidirectional decoders to the broadcast channel. Additionally, to improve the performance of unidirectional decoding, we utilize not only the correlation between adjacent words in the same text but also the correlation between words in different languages with the same meaning in the beam search process.},

A total of 222 patients were enrolled in our observational study. Anagraphical and anamnestic data, COVID-19 signs and symptoms, COVID-19 therapy, hematochemical test results, and prior therapies administered to patients are used as predictors. A set of 55 features, all of which can be taken in the first hours of the patient’s hospitalization, was considered. Different solutions were compared achieving the best performance with a sequential convolutional neural network-based model merged in an ensemble with two different meta-learners linked in cascade. We obtained a median absolute error of 2.7 days (IQR = 3.0) in predicting the duration of the infection; the error was equally distributed in the infection duration range. This tool could preemptively give an outlook of the COVID-19 patients’ expected path and the associated hospitalization effort. The proposed solution could be viable in tackling the huge burden and the logistics complexity of hospitals or rehabilitation centers during the pandemic waves.

Recent advances in visual recognition are based on image classification and artefacts detection within these images. The purpose of this study is to classify chest X-ray images of COVID-19 artefacts in changed real-world situations. A novel Bayesian optimization-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model is proposed for the recognition of chest X-ray images. The proposed model has two main components. The first one utilizes CNN to extract and learn deep features. The second component is a Bayesian-based optimizer that is used to tune the CNN hyperparameters according to an objective function. The used large-scale and balanced dataset comprises 10,848 images (i.e., 3616 COVID-19, 3616 normal cases, and 3616 Pneumonia). In the first ablation investigation, we compared Bayesian optimization to three distinct ablation scenarios. We used convergence charts and accuracy to compare the three scenarios. We noticed that the Bayesian search-derived optimal architecture achieved 96% accuracy. To assist qualitative researchers, address their research questions in a methodologically sound manner, a comparison of research method and theme analysis methods was provided.

To evaluate the impact of the nonpharmaceutical governmental interventions applied by different cities such as the closure of schools and business in general in the evolution and epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we constructed a full-sized agent-based epidemiological model adjusted to the singularities of particular cities. The model incorporates detailed demographic information, mobility networks segregated by economic segments, and restricting bills enacted during the pandemic period. As a case study, we analyzed the early response of the City of Natal a midsized state capital to the pandemic. Although our results indicate that the governmental response could be improved, the restrictive mobility acts saved many lives.

Most of the 7000 rare diseases described to date have a genetic component, typically highly penetrant. However, this vast spectrum of genetic variability remains yet unexplored with respect to possible interactions with COVID-19. Here, a mathematical mechanistic model of the COVID-19 molecular disease mechanism has been used to detect potential interactions between rare disease genes and the COVID-19 infection process and downstream consequences. Out of the 2518 disease genes analyzed, causative of 3854 rare diseases, a total of 254 genes have a direct effect on the COVID-19 molecular disease mechanism and 207 have an indirect effect revealed by a significant strong correlation. This remarkable potential of interaction occurs for &gt;300 rare diseases. Mechanistic modeling of COVID-19 disease map has allowed a holistic systematic analysis of the potential interactions between the loss of function in known rare disease genes and the pathological consequences of COVID-19 infection. The results identify links between disease genes and COVID-19 hallmarks and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach for future preventive measures in some rare diseases.},

However, when it comes to scenarios where frequent monitoring is needed, the computational overhead of these verification queries in terms of volume demonstrates that backdoor-based watermarking appears to be too sensitive to outlier detection attacks and cannot guarantee the secrecy of the triggers.To solve this issue, we introduce BlindSpot, to watermark machine learning models through fairness. Our trigger-less approach is compatible with a high number of verification queries while being robust to outlier detection attacks. We show on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets that BlindSpot is efficiently watermarking models while robust to outlier detection attacks, at a performance cost on the accuracy of 2%.},

Public health guidelines from the state/province, federal, and global level have inundated recreation professionals with messaging to inform reopening strategies. Rasmussen’s risk management framework served as a guide to explore the stakeholders, decisions, and environmental conditions influencing COVID-19 reopening plans and policies in collegiate recreation. A case study of four collegiate recreation departments was conducted, with document analysis employed to examine and interpret reopening plans. The findings highlight campus offices and leadership as major stakeholders in reopening guidelines; risk management decisions utilizing a phased reopening approach that emphasized screening, mask mandates, social distancing and touch points, equipment and floor plans, and cleaning; and communication as a critical environmental condition. Implications for collegiate recreation practitioners include strategies for decision making, dissemination of information, staff training, risk mitigation, and policy enforcement.},

Using a dataset of 30 million public tweets, we use machine learning to identify tweets that contain self-disclosure of loneliness. We find that thousands more people turned to Twitter to express their loneliness during the lockdowns; however, this effect normalized within a month, demonstrating the “ordinization” effect on a collective level. Furthermore, lockdown brought a marked shift in the weekly timings of posting and a change in the accompanying emotions, which were more positive and other-focused. Finally, based on a qualitative analysis, we propose an updated typology of loneliness that captures the possibilities offered by the affordances of social media. Our findings illustrate the profound effect lockdowns had on the societal psychological state and emphasize the importance of mental health resources during extreme and isolating events.},

Multiple utility metrics have been proposed and used to evaluate synthetic data. However, they have not been validated in general or for comparing SDG methods. Objective: This study evaluates the ability of common utility metrics to rank SDG methods according to performance on a specific analytic workload. The workload of interest is the use of synthetic data for logistic regression prediction models, which is a very frequent workload in health research. Methods: We evaluated 6 utility metrics on 30 different health data sets and 3 different SDG methods (a Bayesian network, a Generative Adversarial Network, and sequential tree synthesis). These metrics were computed by averaging across 20 synthetic data sets from the same generative model. The metrics were then tested on their ability to rank the SDG methods based on prediction performance. Prediction performance was defined as the difference between each of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve values on synthetic data logistic regression prediction models versus real data models. Results: The utility metric best able to rank SDG methods was the multivariate Hellinger distance based on a Gaussian copula representation of real and synthetic joint distributions. Conclusions: This study has validated a generative model utility metric, the multivariate Hellinger distance, which can be used to reliably rank competing SDG methods on the same data set. The Hellinger distance metric can be used to evaluate and compare alternate SDG methods.},

Nowadays, it is essential to monitor the liquidity crisis, which is closely linked to corporate crises. The aim of the paper is to analyse a selected sector of the economy from the perspective of the corporate crisis and to identify the factors of crisis. More than 2000 engineering companies in Slovakia were analysed during the period from 2015 to 2019 with the aim of analysing financial results, especially in the area of financial forecast for the future. In the analysis, statistical testing of the significance of relationships using the Spearman correlation coefficient, the significance of differences by the power of t-test, regression and clustering were used. A significant part of the paper is the analysis of selected indicators of the company's crisis-Altman's Z score and the IN05 index. The results indicate that engineering companies in Slovakia are achieving good results and their financial situation is improving within the years between 2015-2019. The results can also be used as a starting point for research concerning the impact of COVID-19 in this area. In the context of corporate crisis management, engineering companies behave in the same way but it is necessary to monitor individual factors that can detect a corporate crisis. Possible measures would thus lead to the stabilization of financial results and long-term sustainable positive prospects for companies in the future.},

Existing research rarely investigates the time-updated dynamic in project complexity as the project process progresses. This study develops a novel systematic soft computing approach based on Bayesian inference to explore the evolutionary dynamics in project complexity under uncertainty. By learning the network structure and parameters from given data, a dynamic Bayesian network model is established to simulate the complex interrelations among 7 complexity-related variables. The developed approach is capable of performing predictive, sensitivity, and diagnostic analysis on a quantitative basis. The construction project of EXPO 2010 is used to testify the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach. Results indicate that (1) more attention should be paid to technological complexity and task complexity in the process of complexity management; (2) the developed dynamic Bayesian network approach can model the evolutionary dynamics of project complexity at different scenarios; and (3) the complexity level of a specific construction project over time can be predicted in a dynamic manner. This research contributes to (a) the state of the knowledge by proposing a systematic soft computing methodology that can model and identify the dynamic interactions of project complexity factors over time, and (b) the state of the practice by gaining a better understanding of the most sensitive factors for managing complexity in a changing project environment.},

   abstract = {Human mobility prediction is an important task in the field of spatiotemporal sequential data mining and urban computing. Despite the extensive work on mining human mobility behavior, little attention was paid to the problem of successive mobility prediction. The state-of-the-art methods of human mobility prediction are mainly based on supervised learning. To achieve higher predictability and adapt well to the successive mobility prediction, there are four key challenges: 1) disability to the circumstance that the optimizing target is discrete-continuous hybrid and non-differentiable. In our work, we assume that the user's demands are always multi-targeted and can be modeled as a discrete-continuous hybrid function; 2) difficulty to alter the recommendation strategy flexibly according to the changes in user needs in real scenarios; 3) error propagation and exposure bias issues when predicting multiple points in successive mobility prediction; 4) cannot interactively explore user's potential interest that does not appear in the history. While previous methods met these difficulties, reinforcement learning (RL) is an intuitive answer for this task to settle these issues. We innovatively introduce RL to the successive prediction task. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a Markov Decision Process. We further propose a framework - RLMob to solve our problem. A simulated environment is carefully designed. An actor-critic framework with an instance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is applied to adapt to our scene with a large state space. Experiments show that on the task, the performance of our approach is consistently superior to that of the compared approaches.},

   abstract = {In an ageing society, the at-home use of Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) could provide remote monitoring of their users’ well-being, together with physical and psychological support. However, private home environments are particularly challenging for SARs, due to their unstructured and dynamic nature which often contributes to robots’ failures. For this reason, even though several prototypes of SARs for elderly care have been developed, their commercialization and wide- spread at-home use are yet to be effective. In this paper, we analyze how including the end users’ feedback impacts the SARs reliability and acceptance. To do so, we introduce a Monitoring and Logging System (MLS) for remote supervision, which increases the explainability of SAR-based systems deployed in older adults’ apartments, while also allowing the exchange of feedback between caregivers, technicians, and older adults. We then present an extensive field study showing how long-term deployment of autonomous SARs can be accomplished by relying on such a feedback loop to address any potential issue. To this end, we provide the results obtained in a 130-week long study where autonomous SARs were deployed in the apartments of 10 older adults, with the aim of possibly serving and assisting future practitioners, with the knowledge collected from this extensive experimental campaign, to fill the gap that currently exists for the widespread adoption of SARs.},

However, as technology is evolving, highly sophisticated tools and techniques are being used by hedge funds and other investment banks to track down these movements and turn this into an opportunity. In this paper, we try to analyse how recurrent neural network (RNN) with long- and short-term memory architecture performs under volatile market conditions. For this study, we tried to perform a comparative analysis between two models within two successive time periods, where one is trained in a volatile market condition and the other in a relatively low volatile market condition. The results showed that the RNN model is less accurate in predicting the prices in a volatile market compared to a relatively low volatile market. We also compared these two models to a separate model where we trained using the combined data from the two successive time periods. Even though the addition in data points for the neural network produced a better result compared to the model trained under volatile conditions, it did not significantly perform better than the model, which was trained in the low volatile period.},

Objective: We undertook a multimethod study to understand the key factors associated with successful and less successful experiences of virtual specialist care, particularly as they relate to the patient experience of care. Methods: This study was designed as a multimethod patient experience study using survey methods, descriptive qualitative interview methodology, and administrative virtual care data collected by the hospital decision support team. Six specialty departments participated in the study (endoscopy, orthopedics, neurology, hematology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology). All patients who could speak and read English and attended a virtual specialist appointment in a participating clinic at St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) between October 1, 2020, and January 30, 2021, were eligible to participate. Results: During the study period, 51,702 virtual specialist visits were conducted in the departments that participated in the study. Of those, 96% were conducted by telephone and 4% by video. In both the survey and interview data, there was an overall consensus that virtual care is a satisfying alternative to in-person care, with benefits such as reduced travel, cost, time, and SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and increased convenience. Our analysis further revealed that the specific reason for the visit and the nature and status of the medical condition are important considerations in terms of guidance on where virtual care is most effective. Technology issues were not reported as a major challenge in our data, given that the majority of ``virtual'' visits reported by our participants were conducted by telephone, which is an important distinction. Despite the positive value of virtual care discussed by the majority of interview participants, 50% of the survey respondents still indicated they would prefer to see their physician in person. Conclusions: Patient experience data collected in this study indicate a high level of satisfaction with virtual specialty care, but also signal that there are nuances to be considered to ensure it is an appropriate and sustainable part of the standard of care.},

Metabolic disorders, mental illnesses, and musculoskeletal injuries are also caused by the physical inactivity and chronic stress at work, threatening office workers' physical and physiological health. In the modern vision of smart workplaces, cyber-physical systems play a central role to augment objects, environments, and workers with integrated sensing, data processing, and communication capabilities. In this context, a work engagement system is proposed to monitor psycho-physical comfort and provide health suggestion to the office workers. Recognizing their activity, such as sitting postures and facial expressions, could help assessing the level of work engagement. In particular, head and body posture could reflects their state of engagement, boredom or neutral condition. In this paper we proposed a method to recognize such activities using an infrared sensor array by analyzing the sitting postures. The proposed approach can unobstructively sense their activities in a privacy-preserving way. To evaluate the performance of the system, a working scenario has been set up, and their activities were annotated by reviewing the video of the subjects. We carried out an experimental analysis and compared Decision Tree and k-NN classifiers, both of them showed high recognition rate for the eight postures. As to the work engagement assessment, we analyzed the sitting postures to give the users suggestions to take a break when the postures such as lean left/right with arm support, lean left/right without arm support happens very often.},

In the field of recommender systems, this issue is also widely observed, as known as temporal dynamics in user behavior. Furthermore, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic related contingencies, people shift their behavior patterns extremely and tend to imitate others' opinions. The changes in user behavior may not be always rational. Thus, irrational behavior may impair the knowledge learned by the algorithm. It can cause herd effects and aggravate the popularity bias in recommender systems due to the irrational behavior of users. However, related research usually pays attention to the concept drift of individuals and overlooks the synergistic effect among users in the same social group. We conduct a study on user behavior to detect the collaborative concept drifts among users. Also, we empirically study the increase of experience of individuals can weaken herding effects. Our results suggest the CF models are highly impacted by the herd behavior and our findings could provide useful implications for the design of future recommender algorithms.},

We construct paths for consumption and employment over the crisis, accounting for heterogeneous risk of unemployment across demographics, government transfers, and substitution between expenditure categories that vary in contact intensity. Our model simulations yield a heterogeneous effect of COVID-19 across the income distribution. Low-income households face the highest risk of unemployment, but transfers provide generous income replacement. Middle-income job losers see the fastest rise in debt because transfers only partially replace lost income. Most unplanned savings are accumulated by high-income households that face lower risk of unemployment and larger declines in hard-to-distance spending. We find the rise in savings could generate a brief jump of nearly 6% of monthly consumption.},

We perform a real-time nowcasting experiment by using a highly disaggregated framework among popular, simple univariate approaches. We demonstrate that pure estimates of online price changes are already effective in nowcasting food inflation, but accounting for online food prices in a simple, recursively optimized model delivers further gains in the nowcast accuracy. Our framework outperforms various other approaches, including judgmental methods, traditional benchmarks, and model combinations. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, its nowcasting quality has improved compared to other approaches and remained comparable with judgmental nowcasts. We also show that nowcast accuracy increases with the volume of online data, but their quality and relevance are essential for providing accurate in-sample fit and out-of-sample nowcasts. We conclude that online prices can markedly aid the decision-making process at central banks.},

   abstract = {Food waste is a significant problem within public catering establishments in any normal situation. During spring 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic placed the public catering system under greater pressure, revealing weaknesses within the system and generation of food waste due to rapidly changing consumption patterns. In times of crisis, it is especially important to conserve resources and allocate existing resources to areas where they can be of most use, but this poses significant challenges. This study evaluated the potential of a forecasting model to predict guest attendance during the start and throughout the pandemic. This was done by collecting data on guest attendance in Swedish school and preschool catering establishments before and during the pandemic, and using a machine learning approach to predict future guest attendance based on historical data. Comparison of various learning methods revealed that random forest produced more accurate forecasts than a simple artificial neural network, with conditional mean absolute prediction error of <0.15 for the trained dataset. Economic savings were obtained by forecasting compared with a no-plan scenario, supporting selection of the random forest approach for effective forecasting of meal planning. Overall, the results obtained using forecasting models for meal planning in times of crisis confirmed their usefulness. Continuous use can improve estimates for the test period, due to the agile and flexible nature of these models. This is particularly important when guest attendance is unpredictable, so that production planning can be optimized to reduce food waste and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient food system.},

   abstract = {With increasing number of COVID-19 cases globally, all the countries are ramping up the testing numbers. While the RT-PCR kits are available in sufficient quantity in several countries, others are facing challenges with limited availability of testing kits and processing centers in remote areas. This has motivated researchers to find alternate methods of testing which are reliable, easily accessible and faster. Chest X-Ray is one of the modalities that is gaining acceptance as a screening modality. Towards this direction, the paper has two primary contributions. Firstly, we present the COVID-19 Multi-Task Network (COMiT-Net) which is an automated end-to-end network for COVID-19 screening. The proposed network not only predicts whether the CXR has COVID-19 features present or not, it also performs semantic segmentation of the regions of interest to make the model explainable. Secondly, with the help of medical professionals, we manually annotate the lung regions and semantic segmentation of COVID19 symptoms in CXRs taken from the ChestXray-14, CheXpert, and a consolidated COVID-19 dataset. These annotations will be released to the research community. Experiments performed with more than 2500 frontal CXR images show that at 90% specificity, the proposed COMiT-Net yields 96.80% sensitivity.},

Therefore, renewed attention is warranted in critically appraising the implications on which flipped learning is built. Though several studies have reviewed the flipped learning research in the past, the majority has qualitatively synthesized the flipped learning literature, thus, lacking the overall perspective provided quantitatively for appraising the existing state of affairs of flipped learning research in engineering education. This study addresses this gap by objectively mapping the conceptual, intellectual, and social structure of research development in flipped learning using a bibliometric review method. Findings reveal that flipped learning in engineering education is a relatively new field of research and in recent time it has entered into the stage of exponential growth. Findings also show the effectiveness of the flipped learning model to address the challenges of complex pedagogical applications in different fields of engineering education. This study provides a quantitative synopsis of the flipped learning literature which can be used as an anchor for future study.},

We used a linear regression method to look for any dependency between the effective reproduction number with the relative humidity, absolute humidity, and temperature. The effective reproduction number showed a negative correlation with both relative and absolute humidity for most of the Indian states, which are statistically significant.

However, manufacturers engaged in mass customization are currently facing challenges related to implementing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concepts of Industry 4.0 in order to increase responsiveness. In this article, we apply the findings from a two-year design science study to establish the role of manufacturing execution systems/manufacturing operations management (MES/MOM) in an IIoT-enabled brownfield manufacturing enterprise. We also present design recommendations for developing next-generation MES/MOM as a strong core to make factories smart and responsive. First, we analyze the architectural design challenges of MES/MOM in IIoT through a selective literature review. We then present an exploratory case study in which we implement our homegrown MES/MOM data model design based on ISA 95 in Aalborg University's Smart Production Lab, which is a reconfigurable cyber-physical production system. This was achieved through the use of a custom module for the open-source Odoo ERP platform (mainly version 14). Finally, we enrich our case study with three industrial design demonstrators and combine the findings with a quality function deployment (QFD) method to determine design requirements for next-generation IIoT-connected MES/MOM. The results from our QFD analysis indicate that interoperability is the most important characteristic when designing a responsive smart factory, with the highest relative importance of 31% of the eight characteristics we studied.},

As such, a disruption can wreak havoc to a supply chain network, rendering the ability of a firm to respond to these disruptions with appropriate recovery strategies paramount. In this paper, we analyze such recovery strategies in a supply chain network. The specific model we develop aims at predicting a disruption that may occur in a context where smart contracts have been implemented based on blockchain technology. Within this setting, we suggest appropriate measures to be undertaken by an organization to mitigate the disruption and avoid negative performance outcomes as much as possible. If the disruption cannot be avoided, the proposed genetic algorithm-based approach focuses on adopting re-active measures to manage the post-disruption reality. As such, we effectively integrate both pre- and post-disruption scenarios to offer wholistic decision-support in an integrated fashion, extending prior work which mostly developed guidance only for either pre- or post-disruption responses. Specifically, we study the performance of a complex multi-echelon supply chain network, involving multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, under various conditions. The insights derived discern the effect of mitigation measures during a disruption, offering valuable guidance for decision makers.},

   abstract = {The growth of the world's population, especially that of the elderly, along with the outbreak of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 have caused hospitals and healthcare centres to become full, and even economical treatments cost a lot. On that account, the conjunction of wireless body area networks (WBAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare and medical diagnosis has become really important, and is accordingly one of the most popular and attractive areas of the Internet of Things (IoT). In such an IoT, a wireless body area network (WBAN) consists of a miniature sample of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) that can be either implanted in the human body or wearable. Nowadays, IoT has made healthcare evaluation possible. Instead of the patient being constantly hospitalized for treatment, the condition of the person is sent to the health centre by the IoMT over the Internet. IoT enables wireless communication between smart devices on one side and almost anything on the other. Since this network deals with medical and critical conditions, data must be sent to a physician or practitioner in the prescribed period; this indicates that routing is one of the most critical issues. Thus, routing is considered a very important challenge in WBANs. The present study describes thermal (temperature)-aware routing protocols in WBANs. Routing protocols in WBANs are divided into thermal (temperature)-aware, QoS-aware, security-aware, cluster-based, cross-layered, postured-based, cost-effect, link-aware, and opportunistic ones. In a WBAN, temperature rise in implant nodes can damage body tissues, which is dangerous for the patient. Accordingly, here, those algorithms were considered which are presented in thermal (temperature)-aware protocols. This paper first introduces IoT-based WBANs, their routing mechanism and challenges, after which it provides a detailed description of thermal (temperature)-aware algorithms. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms are presented.},

In the case of subjects comprising programming tasks, taking into account the availability of tools and resources that provide opportunities for independent work without teacher supervision, it was necessary to decide whether students should be allowed to work under self-paced learning, or, similar to traditional classes, fixed-schedule learning. Experiences from MOOCs demonstrated that course scheduling is not without impact on the learning process, and may affect the level of student satisfaction with the course. This study determines how course scheduling affected the performance of students attending a database course. The students were divided into two groups, and completed the first module without teacher supervision. During the learning process, they solved programming tasks which were assessed automatically, and then took quizzes to verify what they learned. One of the groups worked with the materials and took the quizzes in accordance with a schedule, and the other group did so without any time constraints. The results demonstrate that students perform better when working under the fixed-schedule model, without any impact on their level of satisfaction with the course. The system of learning not only affected the quiz results in the module where different scheduling was used, but student performance in later parts of the course as well. The results presented in the paper should be of interest to teachers designing remote courses involving self-learning.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the usual working of many hospitalization units (or wards). Few studies have used electronic nursing clinical notes (ENCN) and their unstructured text to identify alterations in patients' feelings and therapeutic procedures of interest. Objective: This study aimed to analyze positive or negative sentiments through inspection of the free text of the ENCN, compare sentiments of ENCN with or without hospitalized patients with COVID-19, carry out temporal analysis of the sentiments of the patients during the start of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and identify the topics in ENCN. Methods: This is a descriptive study with analysis of the text content of ENCN. All ENCNs between January and June 2020 at Guadarrama Hospital (Madrid, Spain) extracted from the CGM Selene Electronic Health Records System were included. Two groups of ENCNs were analyzed: one from hospitalized patients in post–intensive care units for COVID-19 and a second group from hospitalized patients without COVID-19. A sentiment analysis was performed on the lemmatized text, using the National Research Council of Canada, Affin, and Bing dictionaries. A polarity analysis of the sentences was performed using the Bing dictionary, SO Dictionaries V1.11, and Spa dictionary as amplifiers and decrementators. Machine learning techniques were applied to evaluate the presence of significant differences in the ENCN in groups of patients with and those without COVID-19. Finally, a structural analysis of thematic models was performed to study the abstract topics that occur in the ENCN, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling. Results: A total of 37,564 electronic health records were analyzed. Sentiment analysis in ENCN showed that patients with subacute COVID-19 have a higher proportion of positive sentiments than those without COVID-19. Also, there are significant differences in polarity between both groups (Z=5.532, P<.001) with a polarity of 0.108 (SD 0.299) in patients with COVID-19 versus that of 0.09 (SD 0.301) in those without COVID-19. Machine learning modeling reported that despite all models presenting high values, it is the neural network that presents the best indicators (>0.8) and with significant P values between both groups. Through Structural Topic Modeling analysis, the final model containing 10 topics was selected. High correlations were noted among topics 2, 5, and 8 (pressure ulcer and pharmacotherapy treatment), topics 1, 4, 7, and 9 (incidences related to fever and well-being state, and baseline oxygen saturation) and topics 3 and 10 (blood glucose level and pain). Conclusions: The ENCN may help in the development and implementation of more effective programs, which allows patients with COVID-19 to adopt to their prepandemic lifestyle faster. Topic modeling could help identify specific clinical problems in patients and better target the care they receive.},

The union of all these modules builds a semi-automated fact-checking tool able of verifying new claims, to extract related evidence, and to track the evolution of a hoax on a OSN. While individual modules are validated on related benchmarks (mainly MSTS and SICK), the complete architecture is validated using a new dataset called NLI19-SP that is publicly released with COVID-19 related hoaxes and tweets from Spanish social media. Our results show state-of-the-art performance on the individual benchmarks, as well as producing useful analysis of the evolution over time of 61 different hoaxes.},

   abstract = {Personal thermal comfort models hold the promise of a more accurate way to predict thermal comfort and therefore a more reliable approach for managing indoor thermal environments. They can be especially relevant as an assistive tool for people with lower thermal sensitivity or with limitations to thermal management and adaptation, such as older people. Nonetheless, although in constant development, studies on personal comfort models continue to focus on office environments and younger adults. This paper explores the development of personal comfort models to predict older people's thermal needs in their homes and evaluates the models' predictive performances in comparison with conventional generalised approaches. Machine learning and environmental, behavioural, health and skin temperature measurements were used to develop individual models for a set of older adults in South Australia. The results show that, on average, the personal thermal comfort models using all studied inputs, except for health perception, presented an optimal accuracy of 66.72%, a Cohen's Kappa of 50.08% and AUC of 0.77, a superior performance when compared with generalised approaches. Results have also highlighted the need for further research on combining physiological sensing, individualised predictive modelling and wearable comfort systems, as well as on defining thermal preference misclassification costs in the context of older people.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is the worst contagious disaster in the history of humankind, triggering a worldwide sickness pandemic. In lacking specialized treatments or immunizations, finding and eliminating the infection source is the best option to decrease disease transmission and lower sickness and degree of fatality among the general public. Generally, few significant barriers are present in the existing system of monitoring the contamination. One of the obstacles is regarding health-related data storage. The user’s e-health data is kept in a traditional method that might have been compromised if shared with third parties. Secondly, the current disease tracking technologies fail to monitor diseases numerous ways. The tracing system is either personal or location-based. Apart from these, gathering individual consent and sharing their health data with unknown associations is a real-time problem. We propose a blockchain-based data system that maintains confidentiality with transparency. Users can acquire unlimited and nontampered vital routes as the suggested blockchain solution leverages to link the user/patient and approved solvers. Also, automatically executed smart contracts are constructed to desensitize the user ID and reallocation. The anonymous feature delivered by private blockchain with wireless technologies defends the customer’s identity secrecy. We develop a matching approach using machine learning technology. Users may take safeguards in advance by employing our suggested analytical technique for predicting the risk due to infectious source presence.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic activity in numerous sectors due to multiple forms of disruption, including border closures, a stay-at-home policy, and social isolation; the electricity consumption trends in this region will undoubtedly improve. This article examines the impact of COVID-19 on electricity generation and consumption in China during the first two quarters (Q1–Q2) of 2020 and 2021. Furthermore, several governments’ perspectives on COVID-19’s implications for renewable energy development, notably offshore wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV), were examined. Results of this article show that COVID-19 impacts the power industry. According to the analysis, during the first two quarters of 2020, the amount of electricity generated and consumed by China decreased by 1.4 and 1.3 percent, respectively, the capacity of the power plants increased by 5.3 GW and coal consumption dropped by 3.6 g/kWh. Investments in the power generation sector increased by 51.5 billion yuan and investment in the power grid grew by 0.7 billion. Additionally, new generation capacity decreased by 378 GW during the first two quarters of 2020. During the first two quarters of 2021, electricity consumption and production grew by 13.7 and 16.2 percent, respectively. Power plants’ capacity increased by 9.5 GW, while coal consumption for power supply fell by 0.8 g/kWh. The investment in power generation projects increased by 8.9 billion, while investment in power grid projects increased by 4.7 billion. Compared to last year’s same period, 14.92 GW of new capacity was installed. Due to lockdown measures, such as studying at home or working at home, domestic power use in the first two quarters of 2020–2021 increased by 6.6 and 4.5 percent, respectively. To minimize COVID-19’s impact on renewable energy development and assist in building offshore wind power plants, economic and financial measures have been put in place to reduce the epidemic’s effect on solar PV systems.},

   abstract = {Online exams are the most preferred mode of exams in online learning environment. This mode of exam has been even more prevalent and a necessity in the event of a forced closure of face-to-face teaching such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Naturally, conducting online exams poses much greater challenge to preserving academic integrity compared to conducting on-site face-to-face exams. As there is no human proctor for policing the examinee on site, the chances of cheating are high. Various online exam proctoring tools are being used by educational institutes worldwide, which offer different solutions to reduce the chances of cheating. The most common technique followed by these tools is recording of video and audio of the examinee during the whole duration of exam. These videos can be analyzed later by human examiner to detect possible cheating case. However, viewing hours of exam videos for each student can be impractical for a large class and thus detecting cheating would be next to impossible. Although some AI-based tools are being used by some proctoring software to raise flags, they are not always very useful. In this paper we propose a cheating detection technique that analyzes an exam video to extract four types of event data, which are then fed to a pre-trained classification model for detecting cheating activity. We formulate the cheating detection problem as a multivariate time-series classification problem by transforming each video into a multivariate time-series representing the time-varying event data extracted from each frame of the video. We have developed a real dataset of cheating videos and conduct extensive experiments with varying video lengths, different deep learning and traditional machine learning models and feature sets, achieving prediction accuracy as high as 97.7%.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To describe the monthly distribution of COVID-19 hospitalisations, deaths and case-fatality rates (CFR) in Lombardy (Italy) throughout 2020. Methods: We analysed de-identified hospitalisation data comprising all COVID-19-related admissions from 1 February 2020 to 31 December 2020. The overall survival (OS) from time of first hospitalisation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. We estimated monthly CFRs and performed Cox regression models to measure the effects of potential predictors on OS. Results: Hospitalisation and death peaks occurred in March and November 2020. Patients aged ≥70 years had an up to 180 times higher risk of dying compared to younger patients [70–80: HR 58.10 (39.14–86.22); 80–90: 106.68 (71.01–160.27); ≥90: 180.96 (118.80–275.64)]. Risk of death was higher in patients with one or more comorbidities [1: HR 1.27 (95% CI 1.20–1.35); 2: 1.44 (1.33–1.55); ≥3: 1.73 (1.58–1.90)] and in those with specific conditions (hypertension, diabetes). Conclusion: Our data sheds light on the Italian pandemic scenario, uncovering mechanisms and gaps at regional health system level and, on a larger scale, adding to the body of knowledge needed to inform effective health service planning, delivery, and preparedness in times of crisis.},

Identifying optimum heating strategies of current buildings would be a solution to this crisis, which is the main aim of the developed algorithm in this research. The algorithm incorporates a modified version of the simple hourly method from the ISO 13790 standard to determine the hourly heating load and indoor temperatures of buildings based on any heating strategy. Flexibility in the input of building and weather data make this tool versatile with practicality towards building users and policymakers. With this algorithm, a case study to evaluate three commonly used domestic heating strategies has been established for nine different residential buildings in typical cold winter conditions in Germany. Most EU households heat their buildings either continuously throughout the day at fixed temperatures, sporadically at fixed times or at peak loads during the evening. The continuous heating strategy is rated the best consuming minimal energy with consistent temperatures and optimal thermal comfort ranges. The sporadic and peak load heating strategies provide fluctuating indoor temperatures with high standard deviations of up to 8.70°C while consuming a similar cumulative energy to the continuous heating strategy. Additionally, both these aforementioned strategies augment energy poverty and promote indoor mould formation on the building envelope caused by water vapor condensation. Consequently, this algorithm can be applicable to any building type of any region.},

   abstract = {The unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 global sequencing effort has suffered from an analytical bottleneck. Many existing methods for phylogenetic analysis are designed for sparse, static datasets and are too computationally expensive to apply to densely sampled, rapidly expanding datasets when results are needed immediately to inform public health action. For example, public health is often concerned with identifying clusters of closely related samples, but the sheer scale of the data prevents manual inspection and the current computational models are often too expensive in time and resources. Even when results are available, intuitive data exploration tools are of critical importance to effective public health interpretation and action. To help address this need, we present a phylogenetic summary statistic which quickly and efficiently identifies newly introduced strains in a region, resulting clusters of infected individuals, and their putative geographic origins. We show that this approach performs well on simulated data and is congruent with a more sophisticated analysis performed during the pandemic. We also introduce Cluster Tracker (https://clustertracker.gi.ucsc.edu/), a novel interactive web-based tool to facilitate effective and intuitive SARS-CoV-2 geographic data exploration and visualization. Cluster-Tracker is updated daily and automatically identifies and highlights groups of closely related SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from inter-regional transmission across the United States, streamlining public health tracking of local viral diversity and emerging infection clusters. The combination of these open-source tools will empower detailed investigations of the geographic origins and spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other densely-sampled pathogens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJM was supported by T32HG008345.

   abstract = {Short-term forecasts of traditional streams from public health reporting (such as cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) are a key input to public health decision-making during a pandemic. Since early 2020, our research group has worked with data partners to collect, curate, and make publicly available numerous real-time COVID-19 indicators, providing multiple views of pandemic activity in the United States. This paper studies the utility of five such indicators—derived from deidentified medical insurance claims, self-reported symptoms from online surveys, and COVID-related Google search activity—from a forecasting perspective. For each indicator, we ask whether its inclusion in an autoregressive (AR) model leads to improved predictive accuracy relative to the same model excluding it. Such an AR model, without external features, is already competitive with many top COVID-19 forecasting models in use today. Our analysis reveals that 1) inclusion of each of these five indicators improves on the overall predictive accuracy of the AR model; 2) predictive gains are in general most pronounced during times in which COVID cases are trending in “flat” or “down” directions; and 3) one indicator, based on Google searches, seems to be particularly helpful during “up” trends.},

   abstract = {There is a growing need for industrial robots to undertake high tolerance operations in line with Industry 4.0 (I4.0) demands and requirements. This requires robotic accuracy to be understood and quantified within appropriate bounds, relative to their application area. One such area is complex aerospace assembly where robotic accuracy is of particular importance if the full potential and benefits of I4.0 are to be realised in the sector. The standards BS EN ISO 9283:1998 and ISO/TR 13,309:1995 outline the requirements for calculating an industrial robot's accuracy. The standards highlight equipment capable of achieving this and they note that the robot base frame (RBF) must be determined as part of the process. The RBF is an exact position within the robot, and therefore it should be established with both accuracy and precision. However, a specific process or approach is not provided in either standard for the determination of a RBF. This has resulted in the use of bespoke methods by various researchers for the determination of their RBF using metrological equipment and associated software. These ad-hoc methods are not globally applied and the rationale and justification for their use remains unpublished. Previous research that presented a process used to construct the RBF, resulted in a varying RBF origin position when repeated. The work presented in this paper provides the basis for a common approach to the determination of a RBF which integrates metrology hardware with a Design of Experiments (DOE) approach to select an appropriate measurement routine. The DOE approach investigates how different factors (e.g. robot axis used, number of point positions used, their positions, and repetitions of their occurrence) influence the repeatability in establishing the RBF, by measuring the positions of points that the robot attains using different levels for each factor. This study used a Universal Robot to develop and demonstrate the proposed method for RBF determination using the factors that were found to affect point repeatability. This new method was validated by comparing the outcome of the applied process to four methods that used random combinations of factors. The approach was found to increase the repeatability in establishing the RBF origin point by 93.4%, compared to a previous method that used arbitrarily chosen factors.},

Design Cohort study of participants in the Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN) registry. Regression models were fitted to predict a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result using clinical and demographic predictors, as well as an indicator of local SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Setting 32 emergency departments in eight Canadian provinces. Participants 27 665 consecutively enrolled patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in participating emergency departments between 1 March and 30 October 2020. Main outcome measures Positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test result within 14 days of an index emergency department encounter for suspected COVID-19 disease. Results We derived a 10-item CCEDRRN COVID-19 Infection Score using data from 21 743 patients. This score included variables from history and physical examination and an indicator of local disease incidence. The score had a c-statistic of 0.838 with excellent calibration. We externally validated the rule in 5295 patients. The score maintained excellent discrimination and calibration and had superior performance compared with another previously published risk score. Score cut-offs were identified that can rule-in or rule-out SARS-CoV-2 infection without the need for nucleic acid testing with 97.4% sensitivity (95% CI 96.4 to 98.3) and 95.9% specificity (95% CI 95.5 to 96.0). Conclusions The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Infection Score uses clinical characteristics and publicly available indicators of disease incidence to quantify a patient's probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The score can identify patients at sufficiently high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to warrant isolation and empirical therapy prior to test confirmation while also identifying patients at sufficiently low risk of infection that they may not need testing.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Forecasting healthcare demand is essential in epidemic settings, both to inform situational awareness and facilitate resource planning. Ideally, forecasts should be robust across time and locations. During the COVID-19 pandemic in England, it is an ongoing concern that demand for hospital care for COVID-19 patients in England will exceed available resources. METHODS: We made weekly forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital admissions for National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England between August 2020 and April 2021 using three disease-agnostic forecasting models: a mean ensemble of autoregressive time series models, a linear regression model with 7-day-lagged local cases as a predictor, and a scaled convolution of local cases and a delay distribution. We compared their point and probabilistic accuracy to a mean-ensemble of them all and to a simple baseline model of no change from the last day of admissions. We measured predictive performance using the weighted interval score (WIS) and considered how this changed in different scenarios (the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location), as well as how much admissions forecasts improved when future cases were known. RESULTS: All models outperformed the baseline in the majority of scenarios. Forecasting accuracy varied by forecast date and location, depending on the trajectory of the outbreak, and all individual models had instances where they were the top- or bottom-ranked model. Forecasts produced by the mean-ensemble were both the most accurate and most consistently accurate forecasts amongst all the models considered. Forecasting accuracy was improved when using future observed, rather than forecast, cases, especially at longer forecast horizons. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming no change in current admissions is rarely better than including at least a trend. Using confirmed COVID-19 cases as a predictor can improve admissions forecasts in some scenarios, but this is variable and depends on the ability to make consistently good case forecasts. However, ensemble forecasts can make forecasts that make consistently more accurate forecasts across time and locations. Given minimal requirements on data and computation, our admissions forecasting ensemble could be used to anticipate healthcare needs in future epidemic or pandemic settings.},

Materials and Methods: The study employs a retrospective open cohort design, consisting of 382,666 primary care progress notes from 44,828 patients, 54 physicians, and 12 clinics collected 01/01/2017 through 31/12/2020. Non-negative matrix factorization uncovers a meaningful latent topical structure permeating the corpus of primary care notes. The learned latent topical basis is transformed into a multivariate time series data structure. Time series methods and plots showcase the evolution/dynamics of learned topics over the study period and allow the identification of COVID-19 pandemic effects. We perform several post-hoc checks of model robustness to increase trust that descriptive/unsupervised inferences are stable over hyper-parameter configurations and/or data perturbations. Results: Temporal topic modelling uncovers a myriad of pandemic-related effects from the expressive clinical text data. In terms of direct effects on patient-health, topics encoding respiratory disease symptoms display altered dynamics during the pandemic year. Further, the pandemic was associated with a multitude of indirect patient-level effects on topical domains representing mental health, sleep, social and familial dynamics, measurement of vitals/labs, uptake of prevention/screening maneuvers, and referrals to medical specialists. Finally, topic models capture changes in primary care practice patterns resulting from the pandemic, including changes in EMR documentation strategies and the uptake of telemedicine. Conclusion: Temporal topic modelling applied to a large corpus of rich primary care clinical text data, can identify a meaningful topical/thematic summarization which can provide policymakers and public health stakeholders a passive, cost-effective, technology for understanding holistic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary healthcare system and community/public-health.},

   abstract = {Introduction SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a large number of global COVID-19 cases. Strategies such as social isolation, personal hygiene and frequent hand washing have been implemented; however, a protective vaccine is required to achieve sufficient herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection to ultimately control the COVID-19 pandemic. To meet the urgent need for a vaccine, a reduction in the development schedule has been proposed from 10-15 years to 1-2 years. For this reason, this systematic review and meta-analysis protocol aims to compare the side effects, safety and toxicity of COVID-19 vaccines available globally, including their combinations. Methods and analysis We will select randomised controlled trial-type studies that evaluate the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, SCOPUS, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), medRxiv.org, biorxiv.org, preprints.org and the Cochrane Library will be searched for eligible studies until December 2021. Three reviewers will independently screen and select studies, assess methodological quality and extract data. A meta-analysis will be performed, if possible, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations summary of findings will be presented. Ethics and dissemination This study will review published data, and thus it is unnecessary to obtain ethical approval. The findings of this systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021231101.},

   abstract = {In recent decades, the development of transport infrastructure has had a great development, although traffic problems continue to spread due to increase due to the increase in the population in urban areas that require the use of these means of transport. This has led to increased problems related to congestion control, which has a direct impact on citizens: air pollution, fuel consumption, violation of traffic rules, noise pollution, accidents and loss of time. In Latin America, the disorderly growth of cities increases distances and routes, likewise, there is an accelerated increase in the number of cars and motorcycles, which increases the problem. In this sense, intelligent transport systems are an alternative to improve the traffic environment, they incorporate the internet of things and intelligent algorithms, for the collection of data from multiple sources and information processing, respectively, in order to improve the efficiency of the transport flow. However, the processing and modeling of traffic data is challenging due to the complexity of road networks, the space–time dependencies between them, and heterogeneous traffic patterns. In this review study, (i) the smart techniques used for the analysis of mobility data in the prediction of traffic flow in urban areas are grouped, likewise, (ii) the results of implementing said techniques are shown, in addition, (iii) The procedures performed are described and analyzed to understand the benefits and limitations of these smart techniques. Given the above, (iv) the data sets used in the literature and available for use are shown, in addition, (v) the quantifiable results of precision of the various techniques were compared, highlighting advantages and limitations, which allows us to (vi) identify the related challenges and, from there, (vii) propose a general taxonomy in which the knowledge acquired in this traffic flow review converges from a computational approach.},

   abstract = {Lung-related ailments are prevalent all over the world which majorly includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, pneumonia, fibrosis, etc. and now COVID-19 is added to this list. Infection of COVID-19 poses respirational complications with other indications like cough, high fever, and pneumonia. WHO had identified cancer in the lungs as a fatal cancer type amongst others and thus, the timely detection of such cancer is pivotal for an individual’s health. Since the elementary convolutional neural networks have not performed fairly well in identifying atypical image types hence, we recommend a novel and completely automated framework with a deep learning approach for the recognition and classification of chronic pulmonary disorders (CPD) and COVID-pneumonia using Thoracic or Chest X-Ray (CXR) images. A novel three-step, completely automated, approach is presented that first extracts the region of interest from CXR images for preprocessing, and they are then used to detects infected lungs X-rays from the Normal ones. Thereafter, the infected lung images are further classified into COVID-pneumonia, pneumonia, and other chronic pulmonary disorders (OCPD), which might be utilized in the current scenario to help the radiologist in substantiating their diagnosis and in starting well in time treatment of these deadly lung diseases. And finally, highlight the regions in the CXR which are indicative of severe chronic pulmonary disorders like COVID-19 and pneumonia. A detailed investigation of various pivotal parameters based on several experimental outcomes are made here. This paper presents an approach that detects the Normal lung X-rays from infected ones and the infected lung images are further classified into COVID-pneumonia, pneumonia, and other chronic pulmonary disorders with an utmost accuracy of 96.8%. Several other collective performance measurements validate the superiority of the presented model. The proposed framework shows effective results in classifying lung images into Normal, COVID-pneumonia, pneumonia, and other chronic pulmonary disorders (OCPD). This framework can be effectively utilized in this current pandemic scenario to help the radiologist in substantiating their diagnosis and in starting well in time treatment of these deadly lung diseases.},

   abstract = {Mobile apps are increasingly relying on high-throughput and low-latency content delivery, while the available bandwidth on wireless access links is inherently time-varying. The handoffs between base stations and access modes due to user mobility present additional challenges to deliver a high level of user Quality-of-Experience (QoE). The ability to predict the available bandwidth and the upcoming handoffs will give applications valuable leeway to make proactive adjustments to avoid significant QoE degradation. In this paper, we explore the possibility and accuracy of realtime mobile bandwidth and handoff predictions in 4G/LTE and 5G networks. Towards this goal, we collect long consecutive traces with rich bandwidth, channel, and context information from public transportation systems. We develop Recurrent Neural Network models to mine the temporal patterns of bandwidth evolution in fixed-route mobility scenarios. Our models consistently outperform the conventional univariate and multivariate bandwidth prediction models. For the next second bandwidth prediction, in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), our model is on average 15.28% better than the other methods in 4G traces and 15.37% better than the other methods in 5G traces. For 4G & 5G co-existing networks, we propose a new problem of handoff prediction between 4G and 5G, which is important to achieve good application performance in realistic 5G scenarios. We develop classification and regression based prediction models, which achieve more than 80% accuracy in predicting handoffs between 4G and 5G in a recent 5G dataset.},

Our goal in this paper is to survey the literature to extract essential features of RSs and Blockchain (BC), focusing on their integration. Because of the lack of an existing foundation of BC-based RSs, the intrinsic BC aspects in RSs are identified and described. Integrating BC technology within RSs can achieve many benefits such as transparency, decentralization, and security. To that end, a thorough study of the papers on current BC-based RSs is presented along with a synthesized comprehensive taxonomy. Furthermore, a modular RS architecture, encompassing on-chain and off-chain storage and computation processes, is designed. This paper also includes a thorough discussion on the validity of the proposed architecture, BC limitations concerning RSs, and the derivation of a rich set of pointers to future research directions.},

   abstract = {Background: High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) provides noninvasive respiratory support for children who are critically ill who may tolerate it more readily than other noninvasive ventilation (NIV) techniques such as bilevel positive airway pressure and continuous positive airway pressure. Moreover, HFNC may preclude the need for mechanical ventilation (intubation). Nevertheless, NIV or intubation may ultimately be necessary for certain patients. Timely prediction of HFNC failure can provide an indication for increasing respiratory support. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop and compare machine learning (ML) models to predict HFNC failure. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using the Virtual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit database of electronic medical records of patients admitted to a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 2010 and February 2020. Patients aged <19 years, without apnea, and receiving HFNC treatment were included. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model using 517 variables (vital signs, laboratory data, and other clinical parameters) was trained to generate a continuous prediction of HFNC failure, defined as escalation to NIV or intubation within 24 hours of HFNC initiation. For comparison, 7 other models were trained: a logistic regression (LR) using the same 517 variables, another LR using only 14 variables, and 5 additional LSTM-based models using the same 517 variables as the first LSTM model and incorporating additional ML techniques (transfer learning, input perseveration, and ensembling). Performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve at various times following HFNC initiation. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of predictions at 2 hours after HFNC initiation were also evaluated. These metrics were also computed for a cohort with primarily respiratory diagnoses. Results: A total of 834 HFNC trials (455 [54.6%] training, 173 [20.7%] validation, and 206 [24.7%] test) met the inclusion criteria, of which 175 (21%; training: 103/455, 22.6%; validation: 30/173, 17.3%; test: 42/206, 20.4%) escalated to NIV or intubation. The LSTM models trained with transfer learning generally performed better than the LR models, with the best LSTM model achieving an AUROC of 0.78 versus 0.66 for the 14-variable LR and 0.71 for the 517-variable LR 2 hours after initiation. All models except for the 14-variable LR achieved higher AUROCs in the respiratory cohort than in the general intensive care unit population. Conclusions: ML models trained using electronic medical record data were able to identify children at risk of HFNC failure within 24 hours of initiation. LSTM models that incorporated transfer learning, input data perseveration, and ensembling showed improved performance compared with the LR and standard LSTM models.},

However, these virtual assistants have limited mechanisms to suitably help the teaching and learning process, considering that these mechanisms should be advantageous for all the people involved. In this article, we design a model for developing a chatbot that serves as an extra-school tool to carry out academic and administrative tasks and facilitate communication between middle-school students and academic staff (e.g., teachers, social workers, psychologists, and pedagogues). Our approach is designed to help less tech-savvy people by offering them a familiar environment, using a conversational agent to ease and guide their interactions. The proposed model has been validated by implementing a multi-platform chatbot that provides both textual-based and voice-based communications and uses state-of-the-art technology. The chatbot has been tested with the help of students and teachers from a Mexican middle school, and the evaluation results show that our prototype obtained positive usability and user experience endorsements from such end-users.</p>},

   abstract = {Background: Assessment of spine alignment is crucial in the management of scoliosis, but current auto-analysis of spine alignment suffers from low accuracy. We aim to develop and validate a hybrid model named SpineHRNet+, which integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and rule-based methods to improve auto-alignment reliability and interpretability. Methods: From December 2019 to November 2020, 1,542 consecutive patients with scoliosis attending two local scoliosis clinics (The Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital at Sandy Bay in Hong Kong; Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam on Hong Kong Island) were recruited. The biplanar radiographs of each patient were collected with our medical machine EOS™. The collected radiographs were recaptured using smartphones or screenshots, with deidentified images securely stored. Manually labelled landmarks and alignment parameters by a spine surgeon were considered as ground truth (GT). The data were split 8:2 to train and internally test SpineHRNet+, respectively. This was followed by a prospective validation on another 337 patients. Quantitative analyses of landmark predictions were conducted, and reliabilities of auto-alignment were assessed using linear regression and Bland-Altman plots. Deformity severity and sagittal abnormality classifications were evaluated by confusion matrices. Findings: SpineHRNet+ achieved accurate landmark detection with mean Euclidean distance errors of 2·78 and 5·52 pixels on posteroanterior and lateral radiographs, respectively. The mean angle errors between predictions and GT were 3·18° and 6·32° coronally and sagittally. All predicted alignments were strongly correlated with GT (p < 0·001, R2 > 0·97), with minimal overall difference visualised via Bland-Altman plots. For curve detections, 95·7% sensitivity and 88·1% specificity was achieved, and for severity classification, 88·6–90·8% sensitivity was obtained. For sagittal abnormalities, greater than 85·2–88·9% specificity and sensitivity were achieved. Interpretation: The auto-analysis provided by SpineHRNet+ was reliable and continuous and it might offer the potential to assist clinical work and facilitate large-scale clinical studies.

   abstract = {This study reports the prevalence of organic and inorganic gunshot residue (OGSR & IGSR) in various populations using emerging analytical methods. The survey includes over 3,200 samples from six subpopulations. The known shooter samples used various ammunition types: leaded (1), lead-free (2), and a mixture (3) collected as soon as the firearm was discharged or after conducting various post-shooting tasks (4). Background samples originated from individuals who had not fired a weapon in the past 24-hours, separated by low-risk (5) and those with higher exposure to sources that mimic GSR, high-risk (6). Samples were analyzed by LIBS followed by electrochemistry in under 10 min per sample. Lastly, a subset from each population was cross-validated by SEM-EDS for morphological and elemental information, demonstrating LIBS and electrochemistry benefits for fast learning about the composition of large populations. An exploratory method was used to identify the various subgroups' population characteristics and estimate performance rates, with an accuracy of 89.6% when LIBS and EC were combined. In addition, Neural Networks were used to recognize underlying patterns in the data for group classifications, with accuracy>93%. Probabilistic outputs allowed for likelihood ratios (LR) calculations with low rates of misleading evidence (RoME less than 0.8%). The log10 LRs typically ranged from [-5, 0] for non-shooters and [2,9] for shooters, demonstrating good discrimination between the overall populations and a sensible model metric for reporting the weight of the evidence. This study addresses forensic community needs regarding the analysis of GSR evidence and provides a path forward.},

Simultaneously, the number of parameters of state-of-the-art deep learning models has been growing massively, with implications on the memory and computational resources required to train and deploy such models. One approach to control the size of neural networks is retrospectively reducing the number of parameters, so-called neural network pruning.Available research on the impact of neural network pruning on the adversarial robustness is fragmentary and often does not adhere to established principles of robustness evaluation. We close this gap by evaluating the robustness of pruned models against ℓ0, ℓ2, and ℓ∞-attacks for a wide range of attack strengths, several architectures, data sets, pruning methods, and compression rates.Our results confirm that neural network pruning and adversarial robustness are not mutually exclusive. Instead, sweet spots can be found that are favorable in terms of model size and adversarial robustness. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to situations that incorporate additional assumptions on the adversarial scenario and show that depending on the situation, different strategies are optimal.},

   abstract = {We propose a model of retail demand for air travel and ticket price elasticity at the daily booking and individual flight level. Daily bookings are modelled as a non-homogeneous Poisson process with respect to the time to departure. The booking intensity is a function of booking and flight level covariates, including non-linear effects modelled semi-parametrically using penalized splines. Customer heterogeneity is incorporated using a finite mixture model, where the latent segments have covariate-dependent probabilities. We fit the model to a unique dataset of over one million daily counts of bookings for 9 602 scheduled flights on a short-haul route over two years. A control variate approach with a strong instrument corrects for a substantial level of price endogeneity. A rich latent segmentation is uncovered, along with strong covariate effects. The calibrated model can be used to quantify demand and price elasticity for different flights booked on different days prior to departure and is a step towards continuous pricing; something that is a major objective of airlines. As our model is interpretable, forecasts can be created under different scenarios. For instance, while our model is calibrated on data collected prior to COVID-19, many of the empirical insights are likely to remain valid as air travel recovers in the post-COVID-19 period.},

Celebrating the plurality and distinctiveness of social reproduction theorisations, the article deploys three approaches to map the contours of the present conjuncture; namely Social Reproduction Theory, Early Social Reproduction Analyses and Raced Social Reproduction approaches. These provide key complementary insights over the planetary crisis and reorganisation of life, work and death triggered by the pandemic. Through the compounded insights of social reproduction theorisations, the article argues that the pandemic does not represent a crisis of neoliberalism. Rather, it represents its outcome, and deepening of its logics, an argument which is substantiated by exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the reproductive architecture of neoliberal capitalism; on the world of work; and on racialised processes manufacturing different kinds of surplus subjects. In conclusion, the article discusses the political implications of this social reproduction-centred reading of the pandemic for a progressive post-pandemic politics to move beyond pandemic neoliberalism.},

Using a field experiment with real selection interviews, we compare two common selection interview modes—Face-to-Face and videoconference, to evaluate their impact on personality trait assessments. Our findings indicate that candidates scored more highly on agreeableness, openness, extroversion, and conscientiousness, but lower on neuroticism, during a Face-to-Face interview compared with videoconference. There was also greater variation in personality ratings when interview sequence commenced with videoconference followed by Face-to-Face, compared with the reverse order. Our results suggest that Face-to-Face followed by videoconference provide a less distorted assessment of personality traits than videoconference followed by Face-to-Face. This study also contributes to practical and academic debates centred on human and AI selection practices and the use of data analytics in HR processes.},

Our work is split into four technical phases: 1) Evaluate: model and characterize agent performance in adaptively generated simulation environments; 2) Challenge: systematically find chaos factors that expose failures; 3) Fitness: balance challenge and feasibility; and 4) Diversity: maintain a population of scenarios that expose the agent to a range of challenges. The work presented here focuses on the Challenge phase and provides preliminary results for our adaptive domain generation paradigm, known as the adversarial architect. The adversarial architect will use an evolutionary-based optimizer to generate diverse scenarios that start simple and become more challenging as agents learn. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in the Acrobot domain, where we show the adversarial architect generating an Auto Curricula of inertial parameters that effectively guides the learning agent to resilient and effective policies.},

Herein, we describe a 2-week undergraduate laboratory to detect a viral genome in a human DNA sample. The strategy follows a SARS-CoV-2 qPCR test in numerous ways. Students are provided isolated DNA representing a mock human patient sample, and determine if a viral genome (bacteriophage lambda) is present using qPCR. A battery of control samples and patient pooling strategies are utilized. The laboratory exercise is successful based on high rates of student success in detecting viral genomes, pre-quiz and post-quiz assessments focusing on viral qPCR testing, and positive student comments.},

   abstract = {Neuronal target recognition is performed by numerous cell-surface transmembrane proteins. Correct folding of these proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen of the neuronal cells before being transported to the plasma membrane of axons or dendrites. Disturbance in this protein folding process in the ER leads to dysfunction of neuronal cell surface molecules, resulting in abnormal neuronal targeting. In this study, we report that the ER-resident protein Meigo in Drosophila, governs the dendrite targeting of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) along the mediolateral axis of the antennal lobe by regulating Toll-6 localization. Loss of Meigo causes Toll-6 mislocalization in the PNs and mediolateral dendrite targeting defects, both of which are suppressed by Toll-6 overexpression. Furthermore, we found that the ER-chaperone protein, Gp93, also regulates the mediolateral targeting of PN dendrites by localization of the Toll-6 protein. Gp93 overexpression in the PN homozygous for the meigo mutation, partially rescued the dendrite targeting defect, while meigo knockdown decreased Gp93 expression levels in cultured cells. These results indicate that the ER-proteins Meigo and Gp93 regulate dendrite targeting by attenuating the amount and localization of cell surface receptors, including Toll-6, implying the unexpected but active involvement of ER proteins in neural wiring.},

However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges to existing deep learning algorithms. People are forced to wear a mask to limit the spread of COVID-19. These face masks occlude a significant portion of the face, thereby posing multiple challenges to existing algorithms. Images captured using surveillance cameras have a low resolution which hinders the model performance. Along with this, skin tone, ethnicity and attire also play a significant role in detection and recognition performance. India is a large country with huge diversity in skin tone and attire of the people. To address the challenges due to masks in the Indian context, we propose a novel Dual Sensor Indian Masked Face (DS- IMF) dataset, which contains images captured in constrained environmental settings with a variety of masks and degrees of occlusion. Multiple experiments are performed on the DS- IMF dataset at different resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate the limitations of existing algorithms on low-resolution masked face images.

This study focuses on the spatiotemporal prediction of hourly particulate matter with different deep-learning modeling techniques for Delhi, India. The secondary data of particulate matter concentrations and the meteorological parameters for the four static monitors in the area are collected from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for dates between January 2019 and April 2021. The study area of South Delhi is divided into hexagonal grids. The data sets at the centroid of each grid are formulated with the spatial interpolation method of inverse distance weighting and Kriging. The hexagonal grids are required to collate the data coming from dynamic monitors. Three models with convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and CNN-LSTM are developed for a total of 15 cells. To evaluate developed models, mean absolute error and root mean square error are used. The results from prediction models show that CNN-LSTM models outperform the other two models. The predictions are accurate for the CNN-LSTM model compared with the values obtained from the static monitor. Also, compared with the existing and individual models, the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model performed better for most of the cells. The prediction models can also provide the pollutant concentration on various routes, which can assist residents in making travel choices based on the air pollution prediction information. Planners and practitioners can replicate the developed models in other regions.},

This article reviews the Mask Sub-Challenge (MSC) of the INTERSPEECH 2020 COMputational PARalinguistics challengE (ComParE), which focused on the following classification task: Given an audio chunk of a speaker, classify whether the speaker is wearing a mask or not. First, we report the collection of the Mask Augsburg Speech Corpus (MASC) and the baseline approaches used to solve the problem, achieving a performance of 71.8% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR). We then summarise the methodologies explored in the submitted and accepted papers that mainly used two common patterns: (i) phonetic-based audio features, or (ii) spectrogram representations of audio combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) typically used in image processing. Most approaches enhance their models by adapting ensembles of different models and attempting to increase the size of the training data using various techniques. We review and discuss the results of the participants of this sub-challenge, where the winner scored a UAR of 80.1%. Moreover, we present the results of fusing the approaches, leading to a UAR of 82.6%. Finally, we present a smartphone app that can be used as a proof of concept demonstration to detect in real-time whether users are wearing a face mask; we also benchmark the run-time of the best models.},

With the constant increase in the number of severe COVID-19 infections, an essential area of research has been directed towards predicting the mortality rate of these patients, in order to make informed medical decisions about the necessary healthcare priorities. Although a large amount of research has attempted to predict the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients, the association between the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients and their underlying health conditions has been given significantly less attention. Meanwhile, patients with underlying conditions often face a worse COVID-19 prognosis. Therefore, the goal of this study was to classify the mortality rate of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, who also suffer from underlying health conditions or comorbidities. To achieve our goal, we applied machine learning (ML) models on a new publicly available dataset, not investigated by any existing literature. The dataset provides detailed information on 582 COVID-19 patients and facilitates a robust forecasting model of the mortality rate. The dataset was analysed using seven ML classifiers, namely, Bagging, J48, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), na\"\\{\i\\}ve Bayes (NB), and threshold selector. A comparative analysis was performed across the seven ML techniques, and their performance was assessed based on evaluation parameters including classification accuracy, true-positive rate, and false-positive rate. The best performance was demonstrated by the Bagging algorithm with an accuracy of 83.55% when using all the dataset features. The findings are intended to assist researchers and physicians in the early identification of at-risk COVID-19 patients and to make the appropriate intensive care decisions.},

Most studies focused on the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic observed in the first half of 2020. Numerous studies have reported significant associations between COVID-19 mortality and relevant variables, for instance obesity, healthcare system indicators such as hospital beds density, and bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunization. In this work, we investigated the role of ABO/Rh blood groups at three different stages of the pandemic while accounting for demographic, economic, and health system related confounding factors. Using a machine learning approach, we found that the “B+” blood group frequency is an important factor at all stages of the pandemic, confirming previous findings that blood groups are linked to COVID-19 severity and fatal outcome.},

In large-scale dynamical networks, it is often difficult or physically impossible to have enough sensor nodes to make the system fully observable. Even if the system is in principle observable, high dimensionality poses fundamental limits on the computational tractability and performance of a full-state observer. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we instead require the system to be functionally observable, meaning that a targeted subset of state variables can be reconstructed from the available measurements. Here, we develop a graph-based theory of functional observability, which leads to highly scalable algorithms to 1) determine the minimal set of required sensors and 2) design the corresponding state observer of minimum order. Compared with the full-state observer, the proposed functional observer achieves the same estimation quality with substantially less sensing and fewer computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale networks. We apply the proposed methods to the detection of cyberattacks in power grids from limited phase measurement data and the inference of the prevalence rate of infection during an epidemic under limited testing conditions. The applications demonstrate that the functional observer can significantly scale up our ability to explore otherwise inaccessible dynamical processes on complex networks.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To compare clinical characteristics, outcomes, and resource consumption of patients with COVID-19 and seasonal influenza requiring supplemental oxygen. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary-care hospital. Patients admitted due to seasonal influenza between 2017 and 2019, or with COVID-19 between March and May 2020 requiring supplemental oxygen were compared. Primary outcome: 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: 90-day mortality and hospitalization costs. Attempted sample size to detect an 11% difference in mortality was 187 patients per group. RESULTS: COVID-19 cases were younger (median years, 67 (IQR 54-78) vs 76 (IQR 64-83); p < 0.001) and more frequently overweight whereas influenza cases had more hypertension, immunosuppression, and chronic heart, respiratory and renal disease. Compared to influenza, COVID-19 cases had more pneumonia (98% vs 60%, <0.001), higher MEWS and CURB-65 scores and were more likely to show worse progression on the WHO ordinal scale (33% vs 4%; p < 0.001). The 30-day mortality rate was higher for COVID-19 than for influenza: 15% vs 5% (p = 0.001). The median age of non-surviving cases was 81 (IQR 74-88) and 77.5 (IQR 65-84) (p = 0.385), respectively. COVID-19 was independently associated with 30-day (HR 4.6, 95%CI, 2-10.4) and 90-day (HR 5.2, 95%CI, 2.4-11.4) mortality. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including a subgroup considering only patients with pneumonia, did not show different trends. Regarding resource consumption, COVID-19 patients had longer hospital stays and higher critical care, pharmacy, and complementary test costs. CONCLUSIONS: Although influenza patients were older and had more comorbidities, COVID-19 cases requiring supplemental oxygen on admission had worse clinical and economic outcomes.},

It analyses innovative actors engaged in robotic technology and their economic environment (identity, location, industry), and identifies the technological fields more exposed to labour-saving innovations. It exploits advanced natural language processing and probabilistic topic modelling techniques applied to the universe of USPTO patent applications between 2009 and 2018, matched with the ORBIS (Bureau van Dijk) firm-level dataset. The results show that labour-saving patent holders comprise not only robot producers, but mainly adopters. Consequently, labour-saving robotic patents appear along the entire supply chain. Additionally, labour-saving innovations are directed towards manual activities in services (e.g. in the logistics sector), activities entailing social intelligence (e.g. in the healthcare sector) and cognitive skills (e.g. learning and predicting).},

   abstract = {Objectives: B-lines are ultrasound artifacts that can be used to detect a variety of pathologic lung conditions. Computer-aided methods to detect and quantify B-lines may standardize quantification and improve diagnosis by novice users. We sought to test the performance of an automated algorithm for the detection and quantification of B-lines in a handheld ultrasound device (HHUD). Methods: Ultrasound images were prospectively collected on adult emergency department patients with dyspnea. Images from the first 124 patients were used for algorithm development. Clips from 80 unique subjects for testing were randomly selected in a predefined proportion of B-lines (0 B-lines, 1–2 B-lines, 3 or more B-lines) and blindly reviewed by five experts using both a manual and reviewer-adjusted process. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and weighted kappa were used to measure agreement, while an a priori threshold of an ICC (3,k) of 0.75 and precision of 0.3 were used to define adequate performance. Results: ICC between the algorithm and manual count was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–0.90), with a precision of 0.15. ICC between the reviewer-adjusted count and the algorithm count was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.96), and the ICC between the manual and reviewer-adjusted counts was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.96). Weighted kappa was 0.72 (95% CI 0.49–0.95), 0.88 (95% CI 0.74–1), and 0.85 (95% CI 0.89–0.96), respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a high correlation between point-of-care ultrasound experts and an automated algorithm to identify and quantify B-lines using an HHUD. Future research may incorporate this HHUD in clinical studies in multiple settings and users of varying experience levels.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Our study compares two national COVID-19 vaccination plan strategies—high-risk prioritization and no prioritization—and estimates their cost-effectiveness compared with no vaccination, to generate possible recommendations for future vaccination plans. Methods: We developed a Markov discrete-time, compartmental, deterministic model stratified by Colombian departments, healthcare workers, comorbidities, and age groups and calibrated to seroprevalence, cases, and deaths. The model simulates three scenarios: no vaccination, no prioritization ofvaccination, and prioritization of high-risk population. The study presents the perspective of the health system of Colombia, including the direct health costs financed by the government and the direct health outcomes related to the infection. We measured symptomatic cases, deaths, and costs for each of the three scenarios from the start of the vaccination rollout to February 20, 2023. Results: Both for the base-case and across multiple sensitivity analyses, the high-risk prioritization proves to be the most cost- effective of the considered strategies. An increment of US$255 million results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$3339 per disability-adjusted life-year avoided. The simulations show that prioritization of high-risk population reduces symptomatic cases by 3.4% and deaths by 20.1% compared with no vaccination. The no-prioritization strategy is still cost- effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$5223.66, but the sensitivity analysis the show potential risks of losing cost-effectiveness under the cost-effectiveness threshold (one gross domestic product per averted disability- adjusted life-year). Conclusions: The high-risk prioritization strategy is consistently more cost-effective than the no-prioritization strategy across multiple scenarios. High-risk prioritization is the recommended strategy in low-resource settings to reduce the burden of disease.},

   abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was originally identified in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 and it spread rapidly throughout the globe, causing a threat to human life. Since targeted therapies are deficient, scientists all over the world have an opportunity to develop novel drug therapies to combat COVID-19. After the declaration of a global medical emergency, it was established that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could permit the use of emergency testing, treatments, and vaccines to decrease suffering, and loss of life, and restore the nation's health and security. The FDA has approved the use of remdesivir and its analogs as an antiviral medication, to treat COVID-19. The primary protease of SARS-CoV-2, which has the potential to regulate coronavirus proliferation, has been a viable target for the discovery of medicines against SARS-CoV-2. The present research deals with the in silico technique to screen phytocompounds from a traditional medicinal plant, Bauhinia variegata for potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Dried leaves of the plant B. variegata were used to prepare aqueous and methanol extract and the constituents were analyzed using the GC-MS technique. A total of 57 compounds were retrieved from the aqueous and methanol extract analysis. Among these, three lead compounds (2,5 dimethyl 1-H Pyrrole, 2,3 diphenyl cyclopropyl methyl phenyl sulphoxide, and Benzonitrile m phenethyl) were shown to have the highest binding affinity (−5.719 to −5.580 kcal/mol) towards SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The post MD simulation results also revealed the favorable confirmation and stability of the selected lead compounds with Mpro as per trajectory analysis. The Prime MM/GBSA binding free energy supports this finding, the top lead compound 2,3 diphenyl cyclopropyl methyl phenyl sulphoxide showed high binding free energy (−64.377 ± 5.24 kcal/mol) towards Mpro which reflects the binding stability of the molecule with Mpro. The binding free energy of the complexes was strongly influenced by His, Gln, and Glu residues. All of the molecules chosen are found to have strong pharmacokinetic characteristics and show drug-likeness properties. The lead compounds present acute toxicity (LD50) values ranging from 670 mg/kg to 2500 mg/kg; with toxicity classifications of 4 and 5 classes. Thus, these compounds could behave as probable lead candidates for treatment against SARS-CoV-2. However further in vitro and in vivo studies are required for the development of medication against SARS-CoV-2.},

Analysis may be further complicated by quickly evolving decision-maker priorities and the potential need to make decisions quickly as new information comes available. To provide a forum to discuss these challenges, a virtual conference, “Decision Making for Emerging Risks,” was held on June 22–23, 2021, sponsored jointly by the Decision Analysis Society of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences and the Decision Analysis and Risk specialty group in the Society for Risk Analysis. Speakers reflected on the work to support decision-makers related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as experiences in emerging risks across domains from cybersecurity, infrastructure, transportation, energy, food safety, national security, and climate change. Here, we distill the key findings to propose a set of best practice principles for a “decision-first” approach for emerging risks. These discussions underscore the importance of scoping the decision context and the shared responsibility for the development and implementation of the analysis between the analyst and the decision-maker when the context can evolve rapidly. Emerging risks may also favor simpler analytical approaches that increase transparency, ease of explanation, and ability to conduct new analyses quickly. Continued dialogue by the decision and risk analysis communities on the use and development of models for emerging risks will enhance the credibility and usefulness of these approaches.},

One of the most active areas of inquiry into misinformation examines how the cognitive sophistication of people impacts their ability to fall for misleading content. In this paper, we capture sophistication by studying how misinformation affects the two canonical models of the social learning literature: sophisticated (Bayesian) and naive (DeGroot) learning. We show that sophisticated agents can be more likely to fall for misinformation. Our model helps explain several experimental and empirical facts from cognitive science, psychology, and the social sciences. It also shows that the intuitions developed in a vast social learning literature should be approached with caution when making policy decisions in the presence of misinformation. We conclude by discussing the relationship between misinformation and increased partisanship and provide an example of how our model can inform the actions of policymakers trying to contain the spread of misinformation.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.},

In medicine, regulators have responded to the challenge of evaluating modified ‘natural’ material as a therapeutic ‘product’ by introducing more flexible assessment schemes. Attempts have also been made to engage stakeholders across the globe on the acceptable parameters for these technologies, particularly in the case of gene editing. Regulatory flexibility and stakeholder engagement are important, but a broader perspective is also needed to respond to the potential disruption of biomodification. Our case-study technologies problematize basic ideas—such as ‘nature’, ‘product’, and ‘donation’—that underpin the legal categories used to regulate biotechnology. Where such foundational concepts are rendered uncertain, a socially responsive and sustainable solution would involve exploring evolutions in these concepts across different societies. We suggest that the global observatory model is a good starting point for this ‘Adaptive Societal Governance’ approach, in which a self-organizing network of scholars and interested parties could carry out the multi-modal (meta)analyses needed to understand societal constructions of ideas inherent to our understanding of ‘life’.</p>},

Without physical interaction, learning a new skill can be frustrating and stressful, especially a skill like Yoga that requires balance and physical coordination. On the one hand, many people cannot afford a personal trainer, but on the other, books and video tutorials do not offer personalized feedback. These limitations make learning Yoga on our own an overwhelming task. We propose a minimal investment model that will help people learn and practice correct Yoga forms from the comfort of their homes in an easy, stress-free manner - just by using their camera. A deep learning model is proposed based on PoseNet which gives an accuracy of 96.77% on the test dataset. We also conducted a survey to measure the satisfaction, efficiency and effectiveness of our system. Overall, 81.8% of the participants felt that our system helped them learn and perform the exercises better and 52.2% of them rated it as being “very good”.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading viral disease and has affected over 100 countries worldwide. The numbers of casualties and cases of infection have escalated particularly in countries with weakened healthcare systems. Recently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the test of choice for diagnosing COVID-19. However, current evidence suggests that COVID-19 infected patients are mostly stimulated from a lung infection after coming in contact with this virus. Therefore, chest X-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT can be a surrogate in some countries where PCR is not readily available. This has forced the scientific community to detect COVID-19 infection from X-ray images and recently proposed machine learning methods offer great promise for fast and accurate detection. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been successfully applied to radiological imaging for improving the accuracy of diagnosis. However, the performance remains limited due to the lack of representative X-ray images available in public benchmark datasets. To alleviate this issue, we propose a self-augmentation mechanism for data augmentation in the feature space rather than in the data space using reconstruction independent component analysis (RICA). Specifically, a unified architecture is proposed which contains a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), a feature augmentation mechanism, and a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). The CNN provides the high-level features extracted at the pooling layer where the augmentation mechanism chooses the most relevant features and generates low-dimensional augmented features. Finally, BiLSTM is used to classify the processed sequential information. We conducted experiments on three publicly available databases to show that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art results with accuracy of 97%, 84% and 98%. Explainability analysis has been carried out using feature visualization through PCA projection and t-SNE plots.},

However, using the IIS method for outlier detection in cross-sectional analysis has remained unexplored. In this paper, we probe the feasibility of the IIS method for cross-sectional data. Meanwhile, we are interested in forecasting performance and covariate selection in the presence of outliers. IIS method uses Autometrics techniques to estimate the covariates and outlier as the number of covariates P>n observations. Besides Autometrics, regularization techniques are a well-known method for covariate selection and forecasting in high-dimensional analysis. However, the efficiency of regularization techniques for the IIS method has remained unexplored. For this purpose, we explore the efficiency of regularization techniques for out-of-sample forecast in the presence of outliers with 6 and 4 standard deviations (SD) and orthogonal covariates. The simulation results indicate that SCAD and MCP outperform in forecasting and covariate selection with 4 SD (20% and 5% outliers) compared to Autometrics. However, LASSO and AdaLASSO select more covariates than SCAD and MCP and possess higher RMSE. Overall, regularization techniques possess the least RMSE than Autometrics, as Autometrics possesses the least average gauge at the cost of the least average potency. We use COVID-19 cross-sectional data collected from 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021 for real data analysis. The SCAD and MCP select CRP level, gender, and other comorbidities as an important predictor of hospital stay with the least out-of-sample RMSE of 7.45 and 7.50, respectively.},

After two doses, Omicron-neutralizing titers were reduced >22-fold compared with Wuhan-neutralizing titers. One month after the third vaccine dose, Omicron-neutralizing titers were increased 23-fold relative to their levels after two doses and were similar to levels of Wuhan-neutralizing titers after two doses. The requirement of a third vaccine dose to effectively neutralize Omicron was confirmed with sera from a subset of participants using live SARS-CoV-2. These data suggest that three doses of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 may protect against Omicron-mediated COVID-19. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This is an inherently multiscale problem, and suitable investigation approaches that can enable evidence-based decision-making for infection control strategies, interventions, and policies; will need to account for flow physics, and occupant behavior. Here, we present a mesoscale infection transmission model for human occupied indoor spaces, by integrating an agent-based human interaction model with a flow physics model for respiratory droplet dynamics and transport. We outline the mathematical and algorithmic details of the modeling framework, and demonstrate its validity using two simple simulation scenarios that verify each of the major sub-models. We then present a detailed case-study of infection transmission in a model indoor space with 60 human occupants; using a systematic set of simulations representing various flow scenarios. Data from the simulations illustrate the utility and efficacy of the devised mesoscale model in resolving flow-mediated infection transmission; and elucidate key trends in infection transmission dynamics amongst the human occupants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

   abstract = {Background: Social distancing is an effective way to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Many students and researchers have already attempted to use computer vision technology to automatically detect human beings in the field of view of a camera and help enforce social distancing. However, because of the present lockdown measures in several countries, the validation of computer vision systems using large-scale datasets is a challenge. Methods: In this paper, a new method is proposed for generating customized datasets and validating deep-learning-based computer vision models using virtual reality (VR) technology. Using VR, we modeled a digital twin (DT) of an existing office space and used it to create a dataset of individuals in different postures, dresses, and locations. To test the proposed solution, we implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting people in a limited-sized dataset of real humans and a simulated dataset of humanoid figures. Results: We detected the number of persons in both the real and synthetic datasets with more than 90% accuracy, and the actual and measured distances were significantly correlated (r=0.99). Finally, we used intermittent-layer- and heatmap-based data visualization techniques to explain the failure modes of a CNN. Conclusions: A new application of DTs is proposed to enhance workplace safety by measuring the social distance between individuals. The use of our proposed pipeline along with a DT of the shared space for visualizing both environmental and human behavior aspects preserves the privacy of individuals and improves the latency of such monitoring systems because only the extracted information is streamed.},

Filters were certified for removal of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid under NSF International certification P473, but not for additional short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids or perfluoroalkyl ether acids (PFEAs) evaluated in this study. Out of 47 targeted analytes, 17 PFAS were detected in filter influent samples (influent ∑PFAS 4.7–131 ng/L). Mixed-effects Tobit regression models showed that the filters effectively removed 97%–99% of all influent PFAS, including short-chain PFEAs, for the entire manufacturer-recommended lifetime of the device. The prevalence of PFAS above the minimum reporting limits was reduced by 99.5%, and the prevalence of any PFAS above the method detection limits was reduced by 92%. The results provide increased confidence in NSF P473-certified filters for the removal of PFAS from private well water.},

One of the most revolutionizing breakthroughs was the introduction of the IoT concept within surgical practice. Our systematic review aims to summarize the most important studies evaluating the IoT concept within surgical practice, focusing on Telesurgery and surgical Telementoring. (2) Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the current literature, focusing on the Internet of Surgical Things in Telesurgery and Telementoring. Forty-eight (48) studies were included in this review. As secondary research questions, we also included brief overviews of the use of IoT in image-guided surgery, and patient Telemonitoring, by systematically analyzing fourteen (14) and nineteen (19) studies, respectively. (3) Results: Data from 219 patients and 757 healthcare professionals were quantitively analyzed. Study designs were primarily observational or based on model development. Palpable advantages from the IoT incorporation mainly include less surgical hours, accessibility to high quality treatment, and safer and more effective surgical education. Despite the described technological advances, and proposed benefits of the systems presented, there are still identifiable gaps in the literature that need to be further explored in a systematic manner. (4) Conclusions: The use of the IoT concept within the surgery domain is a widely incorporated but less investigated concept. Advantages have become palpable over the past decade, yet further research is warranted.},

Furthermore, after the experimental study of students who took the computational physics course (n = 31), the study showed that the modified course could significantly improve student skills regarding overall CT (p value &lt;0.05). However, this research also found that cooperative learning as part of CT had no improvement (p value &gt;0.05).

The growing complexity and uncertainty in the manufacturing sector demand improved decision-making to ensure low operations costs, high productivity, and sustainable use of resources. Artificial neural networks have the inherent capacity to analyze the most uncertain and complex patterns in unstructured decision problems. This review aims to synthesize and provide a comprehensive summary of recent studies on artificial neural network-based decision support systems as applied in manufacturing processes. First, the specific processes in manufacturing where artificial neural network-based decision support systems are used are analyzed. A total of 99 multi-disciplinary publications on artificial neural network-based decision support systems published between 2011 and 2021 are retrieved and processed following a rigorous execution of the designated acceptance criteria and quality assessment. A review of the selected studies indicates a growing interest in applying artificial neural networks in decision support systems. Product and process design, performance evaluation, and predictive maintenance are the main application areas identified. A growing tendency to combine artificial neural network models with other intelligent tools, notably fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithm, is noted to overcome drawbacks such as slow convergence when training the algorithms. Further research should extend to other tools for enriching the performance of artificial neural networks in manufacturing processes.},

   abstract = {Identifying critical nodes and links in graphs is a crucial task. These nodes/links typically represent critical elements/communication links that play a key role in a system's performance. However, a majority of the methods available in the literature on the identification of critical nodes/links are based on an iterative approach that explores each node/link of a graph at a time, repeating for all nodes/links in the graph. Such methods suffer from high computational complexity and the resulting analysis is also network-specific. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a scalable and generic graph neural network (GNN) based framework for identifying critical nodes/links in large complex networks. The proposed framework defines a GNN based model that learns the node/link criticality score on a small representative subset of nodes/links. An appropriately trained model can be employed to predict the scores of unseen nodes/links in large graphs and consequently identify the most critical ones. The scalability of the framework is demonstrated through prediction of nodes/links scores in large scale synthetic and real-world networks. The proposed approach is fairly accurate in approximating the criticality scores and offers a significant computational advantage over conventional approaches.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic affected healthcare systems worldwide. Predictive models developed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and based on timely, centralized and standardized real world patient data could improve management of COVID-19 to achieve better clinical outcomes. The objectives of this manuscript are to describe the structure and technologies used to construct a COVID-19 Data Mart architecture and to present how a large hospital has tackled the challenge of supporting daily management of COVID-19 pandemic emergency, by creating a strong retrospective knowledge base, a real time environment and integrated information dashboard for daily practice and early identification of critical condition at patient level. This framework is also used as an informative, continuously enriched data lake, which is a base for several on-going predictive studies. Methods: The information technology framework for clinical practice and research was described. It was developed using SAS Institute software analytics tool and SAS® Vyia® environment and Open-Source environment R ® and Python ® for fast prototyping and modeling. The included variables and the source extraction procedures were presented. Results: The Data Mart covers a retrospective cohort of 5528 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. People who died were older, had more comorbidities, reported more frequently dyspnea at onset, had higher D-dimer, C-reactive protein and urea nitrogen. The dashboard was developed to support the management of COVID-19 patients at three levels: hospital, single ward and individual care level. Interpretation: The COVID-19 Data Mart based on integration of a large collection of clinical data and an AI-based integrated framework has been developed, based on a set of automated procedures for data mining and retrieval, transformation and integration, and has been embedded in the clinical practice to help managing daily care. Benefits from the availability of a Data Mart include the opportunity to build predictive models with a machine learning approach to identify undescribed clinical phenotypes and to foster hospital networks. A real-time updated dashboard built from the Data Mart may represent a valid tool for a better knowledge of epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19, especially when multiple waves are observed, as well as for epidemic and pandemic events of the same nature (e. g. with critical clinical conditions leading to severe pulmonary inflammation). Therefore, we believe the approach presented in this paper may find several applications in comparable situations even at region or state levels. Finally, models predicting the course of future waves or new pandemics could largely benefit from network of DataMarts.},

This paper proposes a CGPA Predicting Model (CPM) that detects poor academic performance by predicting their graduation cumulative grade point average (CGPA). The proposed model uses a two-layer process that provides students with an estimated final CGPA, given their progress in second- and third-year courses.

   abstract = {Objective: To develop an automatic COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS)–based classification in a multi-demographic setting. Methods: This multi-institutional review boards–approved retrospective study included 2720 chest CT scans (mean age, 58 years [range 18–100 years]) from Italian and Russian patients. Three board-certified radiologists from three countries assessed randomly selected subcohorts from each population and provided CO-RADS–based annotations. CT radiomic features were extracted from the selected subcohorts after preprocessing steps like lung lobe segmentation and automatic noise reduction. We compared three machine learning models, logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF) for the automated CO-RADS classification. Model evaluation was carried out in two scenarios, first, training on a mixed multi-demographic subcohort and testing on an independent hold-out dataset. In the second scenario, training was done on a single demography and externally validated on the other demography. Results: The overall inter-observer agreement for the CO-RADS scoring between the radiologists was substantial (k = 0.80). Irrespective of the type of validation test scenario, suspected COVID-19 CT scans were identified with an accuracy of 84%. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) interpretation showed that the “wavelet_(LH)_GLCM_Imc1” feature had a positive impact on COVID prediction both with and without noise reduction. The application of noise reduction improved the overall performance between the classifiers for all types. Conclusion: Using an automated model based on the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS), we achieved clinically acceptable performance in a multi-demographic setting. This approach can serve as a standardized tool for automated COVID-19 assessment. Keypoints: • Automatic CO-RADS scoring of large-scale multi-demographic chest CTs with mean AUC of 0.93 ± 0.04. • Validation procedure resembles TRIPOD 2b and 3 categories, enhancing the quality of experimental design to test the cross-dataset domain shift between institutions aiding clinical integration. • Identification of COVID-19 pneumonia in the presence of community-acquired pneumonia and other comorbidities with an AUC of 0.92.},

We present Strainflow, a supervised and causally predictive model using unsupervised latent space features of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. Strainflow was trained and validated on 0.9 million sequences for the period December, 2019 to June, 2021 and the frozen model was prospectively validated from July, 2021 to December, 2021. Strainflow captured the rise in cases two months ahead of the Delta and Omicron surges in most countries including the prediction of a surge in India as early as beginning of November, 2021. Entropy analysis of Strainflow unsupervised embeddings clearly reveals the explore-exploit cycles in genomic feature-space, thus adding interpretability to the deep learning based model. We also conducted codon-level analysis of our model for interpretability and biological validity of our unsupervised features. Strainflow application is openly available as an interactive web-application for prospective genomic surveillance of COVID-19 across the globe.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {The cause-and-effect flow of various agents involved in airborne transmission of indoor air viruses has been investigated through a systematic literature review. It has been identified that the airborne virus can stay infectious in the air for hours, and pollutants such as particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Carbon dioxide (CO2), and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) and other air pollutants can enhance the incidence, spread and mortality rates of viral disease. Also, environmental quality parameters such as humidity and temperature have shown considerable influence in virus transmission in indoor spaces. Thus, maintaining adequate indoor air quality levels is vital in mitigating the spread of the airborne virus. The measures adopted in different research studies that can curb airborne transmission of viruses for an improved Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) have been collated for their effectiveness and limitations. A diverse set of building strategies, components, and operation techniques from the recent literature pertaining to the ongoing spread of COVID-19 disease has been systematically presented to understand the current state of techniques and building systems that can minimize the viral spread in built spaces with a special focus on SARS-CoV-2 virus. This comprehensive review will help architects, builders, realtors, and other organizations improve or design a resilient building system to deal with COVID-19 or any such pandemic in the future.},

   abstract = {The inability of a patient to talk, hear, or both for any specific reason can create a worrisome scenario because any form of reaction can deem the brain activity. In such a scenario, Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to measure a patient's responsiveness by observing recorded electrical signals on the scalp. However, reading and interpreting EEG signals remotely is a difficult task due to the lack of an intelligent framework in the healthcare domain. Thus to monitor and analyze the EEG signals remotely with an efficient Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework and analyze these signals, various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have been incorporated. However, the existing ML/DL models do not allow end-users to understand the entire logic behind analyzing those signals that make the IoMT framework decision not transparent. Motivated by the above-mentioned problems, in this paper, an empirical Intelligent Agent-based Bag-of-Neural Networks (IBoNN) model is incorporated in the IoMT framework to make real-time decisions with high accuracy. The IBoNN model is intended to categorize the incoming brain signals based on a collection of neural networks and determine the correct response from EEG signals of the patients. The outperformance of the proposed IBoNN model over the standard ML models is evaluated with a set of performance matrices over a benchmark dataset. From the experimental analysis, it has been observed that the IBoNN model yields an average accuracy of 91%–99% during the categorization of brain responses from EEG signals.},

Digital farming aims to use available information from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges for addressing food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The digital approaches are expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making supports. Digital twin in agriculture is a virtual representation of a farm with great potential for enhancing productivity and efficiency while declining energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of digital twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural con-texts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation, robotics, farm machineries, and food post-harvest processing in agricultural field. Data recording, modeling including artificial intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed. Digital twin systems can support farmers as a next generation of digitalization paradigm by continuous and real-time monitoring of physical world (farm) and updating the state of virtual world.},

   abstract = {This dissertation explores topics where machine learning can be used to improve or expand the scope of health services research.Chapter 1: This study demonstrates the viability of using deep learning to identify people who are likely to benefit from osteoporotic or fragility fracture risk screening using chest radiographs. Previous work has shown that deep learning algorithms can identify osteoporotic individuals across a wide range of imaging modalities. However, the vast majority of studies have focused on patients that have been screened for osteoporosis and the study populations are almost entirely comprised of patients who are already recommended for screening. We develop and validate an algorithm on a large dataset of chest radiographs consisting of 59,737 individuals that is significantly more diverse across both age and sex than the data used in previous work. Using an ensemble of image classification models and conformal prediction, our algorithm was able to identify individuals without an osteoporosis or osteopenia diagnosis that were 1.93 (95% CI: 1.66, 2.26) times more likely to have experienced any fracture and more than twice as likely to experience common osteoporotic fractures, such as hip and pelvis fractures (Est: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.67, 2.88) or spine and rib fractures (Est: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.99, 3.11), after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. Approximately 45% of individuals identified were not currently recommended for screening. We further outline how conformal prediction can be used to adjust the size of the flagged patient population to account for important implementation factors, such as a health centers' capacity to screen additional patients or requirements for a higher standard of evidence when making recommendations that fall outside of current clinical guidelines. The size of the flagged patient population could also be set to match the projected cost-benefit tradeoff of screening additional people.Chapter 2: Early entry by firms in markets for generic pharmaceuticals is paramount for price declines and increasing consumer welfare. The first-mover advantage (FMA), defined as the additional market share a firm earns by entering first compared to entering later, is considered one of the most important incentives for prompt entry into generic markets. Inherent in this definition of FMA is a notion of causality, where, in an ideal but infeasible experiment, we could observe the same firm entering at different times in the same market and compare market shares across different entry timing decisions. This paper will exploit unique characteristics of generic drug markets and advances in doubly robust methods for causal inference to estimate the FMA. Our findings suggest entering first results in a significant advantage when compared to if that same firm entered later. This advantage is mainly accrued through sales in periods where competition is limited and, to a lesser extent, higher market shares during the first two years after the start of competition between generics. The latter point contradicts a number of previous studies that found the FMA is sustained for up to six years after the start of competition between generics. We further characterize the impact that important regulatory features, such as exclusivity periods and the presence of authorized generics, have on the market shares of first entrants and provide evidence to suggest our estimates are unlikely to be explained by unobserved confounding. Chapter 3: COVID-19 interrupted delivery of mental health care in the US. Symptoms associated with various mental disorders increased in prevalence at the same time. The expectation is that treatment would increase with measured need. Departures from that expectation serve to index the degree of disruption in the delivery of mental health care to the US population. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis using prescription claims data covering 89 percent of all prescriptions in the US that compared observed new-starts of common psychotropic medications to forecasted new-starts. Forecasts were generated using the Prophet forecasting model. During the initial course of the COVID-19 pandemic new starts of antidepressants declined by 7.5 percent, anxiolytics by 5.6 percent, and antipsychotics by 2.6 percent compared with expected levels. Declines were more pronounced among children and adolescents, with declines in new starts ranging from 20 to 30% over the same period for the three drug classes. Our findings suggest that there was a large unmet need for mental health treatment in the US attributable to COVID-19 over this period.},

A heterogeneous communication architecture is essential to facilitate collaborative and intelligent medical analytics in the fifth generation and beyond (B5G) networks to intelligently learn and disseminate pandemic-related information and diagnostic results. However, such a technique raises privacy issues pertaining to the health data of the patients. In this paper, we envision a privacy-preserving pandemic response network using a proof-of-concept, aerial–terrestrial network system serving mobile user entities/equipment (UEs). By leveraging the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a lightweight federated learning model is proposed to collaboratively yet privately learn medical (e.g., COVID-19) symptoms with high accuracy using the data collected by individual UEs using ambient sensors and wearable devices. An asynchronous weight updating technique is introduced in federated learning to avoid redundant learning and save precious networking as well as computing resources of the UAVs/UEs. A use-case where an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based model is employed for COVID-19 detection from radiograph images is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading at a fast pace around the world and has a high mortality rate. Since there is no proper treatment of COVID-19 and its multiple variants, for example, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, being more infectious in nature are affecting millions of people, further complicates the detection process, so, victims are at the risk of death. However, timely and accurate diagnosis of this deadly virus can not only save the patients from life loss but can also prevent them from the complex treatment procedures. Accurate segmentation and classification of COVID-19 is a tedious job due to the extensive variations in its shape and similarity with other diseases like Pneumonia. Furthermore, the existing techniques have hardly focused on the infection growth estimation over time which can assist the doctors to better analyze the condition of COVID-19-affected patients. In this work, we tried to overcome the shortcomings of existing studies by proposing a model capable of segmenting, classifying the COVID-19 from computed tomography images, and predicting its behavior over a certain period. The framework comprises four main steps: (i) data preparation, (ii) segmentation, (iii) infection growth estimation, and (iv) classification. After performing the pre-processing step, we introduced the DenseNet-77 based UNET approach. Initially, the DenseNet-77 is used at the Encoder module of the UNET model to calculate the deep keypoints which are later segmented to show the coronavirus region. Then, the infection growth estimation of COVID-19 per patient is estimated using the blob analysis. Finally, we employed the DenseNet-77 framework as an end-to-end network to classify the input images into three classes namely healthy, COVID-19-affected, and pneumonia images. We evaluated the proposed model over the COVID-19-20 and COVIDx CT-2A datasets for segmentation and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques, we performed a cross-dataset evaluation to show the generalization ability of our method. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation confirms that our method is robust to both COVID-19 segmentation and classification and can accurately predict the infection growth in a certain time frame. Research highlights: We present an improved UNET framework with a DenseNet-77-based encoder for deep keypoints extraction to enhance the identification and segmentation performance of the coronavirus while reducing the computational complexity as well. We propose a computationally robust approach for COVID-19 infection segmentation due to fewer model parameters. Robust segmentation of COVID-19 due to accurate feature computation power of DenseNet-77. A module is introduced to predict the infection growth of COVID-19 for a patient to analyze its severity over time. We present such a framework that can effectively classify the samples into several classes, that is, COVID-19, Pneumonia, and healthy samples. Rigorous experimentation was performed including the cross-dataset evaluation to prove the efficacy of the presented technique.},

Empirical studies entailed five reviews, 40 studies focusing on hospital infrastructure adaptation and planning during the pandemics, and 57 studies on modeling the hospital capacity needed, measured mostly by the number of beds. The majority of studies were conducted in high-income countries and published within the first year of the pandemic. The strategies adopted by hospitals can be classified into short-term (repurposing medical and non-medical buildings, remote adjustments, and establishment of de novo structures) and long-term (architectural and engineering modifications, hospital networks, and digital approaches). More research is needed, focusing on specific strategies and the quality assessment of the evidence.</p>},

   abstract = {We consider a single-period inventory problem with random demand with both directly observable and unobservable features that impact the demand distribution. With the recent advances in data collection and analysis technologies, data-driven approaches to classical inventory management problems have gained traction. Specially, machine learning methods are increasingly being integrated into optimization problems. Although data-driven approaches have been developed for the newsvendor problem, they often consider learning from the available data and optimizing the system separate tasks to be performed in sequence. One of the setbacks of this approach is that in the learning phase, costly and cheap mistakes receive equal attention and, in the optimization phase, the optimizer is blind to the confidence of the learner in its estimates for different regions of the problem. To remedy this, we consider an integrated learning and optimization problem for optimizing a newsvendor's strategy facing a complex correlated demand with additional information about the unobservable state of the system. We give an algorithm based on integrating optimization, neural networks and hidden Markov models and use numerical experiments to show the efficiency of our method. In an empirical experiment, the method outperforms the best competitor benchmark by more than 27%, on average, in terms of the system cost. We give further analyses of the performance of the method using a set of numerical experiments.},

   abstract = {Stress has become one of the major reasons for many mental health related issues among students of all age groups, which has resulted in devastating personal losses including suicide. Societal and familial pressure to succeed is high, particularly in developing countries where education is highly valued as a key enabler. As part of stress management during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for online intelligent virtual advisors has risen and, consequently, the need for personalised explanation that is culturally sensitive to the user's context is essential to improve the user's understanding of and trust in the recommendations provided by the virtual advisor. This paper presents the mAnaging stRess at University embodied conversational agent (ECA) that has been adapted for Indian university students from an explainable agent that was found to help Western students reduce their stress by providing study tips with explanations based on the student's beliefs and/or goals. We conducted a research study with sixty students which measured the impact of providing three different patterns of tailored explanations (belief-based, goal-based, and belief and goal-based explanation) on the students' intentions to change the recommended behaviours and the relationship built with the ECA. The experimental results indicate that there was stress reduction across all student groups provided with different types of explanations. Further, the students showed trust and a good working alliance with the conversational agent, along with an intention to change behaviour across all types of explanations. However, it was observed that the user context played an important role in behaviour change intention and hence explanations could be tailored further, making them culturally more relevant to Indian students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been mostly developed, applied and shown to be effective in developed countries. Hence, their design and development are mostly guided by the intended user's needs and preferences. In a Western context, ECAs have been found to be beneficial for reducing study stress in university students. There is a pertinent need for use of low cost, effective technology that can aid academic stress reduction in higher educational institutions in developing countries owing to their high youth populations, lack of adequate mental healthcare facilities and associated social stigma. What this paper adds The adaptation and use of ECAs to reduce study stress in higher education students in a developing country is evaluated. The ECA technology is adapted for an Indian context in terms of its physical appearance, colour, speech dialect and dialog content so that it is culturally more aligned to the target population. The ECA engages in an empathic conversation tailored for the Indian students and their COVID-19 context providing them with explanation-backed behaviour recommendations that take their beliefs and goals into account. The ECA provides three types of explanation: belief-only; goal-only; and both belief and goal. Results of a study carried out in an Indian university with 61 students, randomly assigned to one of the explanation types, to capture their demographics, study stress statistics, behaviour change intentions and trust/working alliance with the conversational agent. The major findings include stress reduction across all explanation groups, development of a positive relationship between the ECA and the students regardless of its explanation pattern, and changes in behaviour intentions across all types of explanations for all recommended behaviours. However, differences in change intentions for certain behaviours indicate further tailoring of explanations is required based on the user context. Implications for practice and/or policy The ECA technology has shown promise in terms of stress reduction amongst Indian students. Higher Education Institutions in developing countries could utilise low-cost and widely accessible ECAs to overcome lack of access to human-based support and reluctance to use available services due to stigmatized attitudes to mental health issues. This technology can be further improved and deployed into a larger number of Indian educational institutions leading to a widespread impact on overall student health and wellbeing. Digital technologies to support mental health have become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in Western countries. The ECA technology evaluated in our study demonstrates its viability and potential value for use in developing countries, with appropriate tailoring.},

We observe that certain groups of students experience the pandemic very differently. Furthermore, we explore the association of self-reported COVID-19 concern with students’ behavior and mental health. We find that heightened COVID-19 concern is correlated with increased depression, anxiety and stress.

   abstract = {How firms address pressing societal needs during crises is not well understood. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted societies worldwide, and many firms quickly developed new product innovations in personal protective equipment – an area outside of their core businesses and with uncertain profitability but demanded by stakeholders. We conducted inductive case studies of eight firms to understand why firms pivot from shareholder- to stakeholder-oriented innovation of product categories new to the firm and how they satisfy new stakeholder needs during crises. The findings suggest a three-stage process model that explains how firms (1) internalize information signalling a lack of product supply that leads to urgent innovation needs, which in turn triggers a shift, (2) how the firm’s extant resources are understood and (3) thus how the capability assembly of new product innovation is initiated. We theorize that the increase in responsiveness to societal crises is a sensitization process. This process explains how for-profit product innovation prior to the pandemic led to the crisis-driven innovation of products new to the firm by temporarily suspending a profit orientation to respond quickly to calls for help. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an unexpected digital revolution, speeding up universities' digital transformation worldwide. It has brought heavy disruptions to travel and mobility worldwide, but it drives the opportunity for hosting region-wide or even international academic exchanges through learning programs, workshops, and conferences via an alternative online mode. This study reports on a case study of a 1-month online aviation learning program that engaged 108 university students from Mainland China and Hong Kong during the lockdown. At first, we first recruited students in Hong Kong; however, the program registration was unsatisfactory. This could be attributed to the students' perceived future aviation career prospects and readiness of emergent remote teaching during the pandemic. In the program, we designed an alternative blended learning approach to attract students to sustain their aviation learning. First, we transformed the activities from face-to-face (F2F) to online settings using digital technologies including flight simulation and virtual visits in a web-conferencing environment. Second, we extended the reach of the event and attracted a larger audience in the neighbouring regions in Mainland China. It turned out that we could successfully recruit 108 students from 20 cities. In the end, students' interviews and motivational surveys indicated that this online learning experience could effectively enhance students' knowledge and motivational gain. Since the government has relaxed the policy of homeschooling, we organised two F2F meetings for students in Hong Kong to connect them together. This blended mode of teaching favoured the students in Hong Kong who showed a greater motivation than those in Mainland China. Furthermore, follow-up interviews for teachers revealed how they invest in new technological equipment and knowledge to support the radical changes. Overall, the virtual event eliminates geographical barriers which successfully motivate a larger audience and gain some online collaboration between universities. This article offered useful evidence for engineering educators to reflect on online informal learning, lab settings and academic exchanges, and motivate more students to revitalise aviation education and industry. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Emergency remote teaching (ERT) caused a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate online mode due to crisis circumstances. After months, educators gained rich online teaching experience and resources, and developed strategies to digitally transform teaching online. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many aviation educators were facing various teaching challenges due to the industry downturn and motivation problems. Although prior research had explored the potential of hands-on activities such as flight simulation and online learning in university settings, few studies have examined students' motivations for online aviation learning, few studies discussed how these technologies are digitally transformed to a blended learning environment. What this paper adds The pandemic drastically affected students' learning in almost every discipline, but in seriously affected industries such as aviation and tourism, extra efforts are needed to investigate how educators support students to sustain their learning and recover the related industries. Motivation questionnaires and interviews were conducted to paint an initial picture of an online aviation education program across university students from Hong Kong and Mainland China. Implications for practice and/or policy This study shifted to examine the implications of the pandemic-imposed online teaching strategies including flight simulation and virtual tours which could improve future university education after the pandemic. This study showed the need of face-to-face blended learning mode to address university students' learning needs to connect physically with professionals and classmates. This study understood how educators motivate university students in urban cities from Hong Kong and Mainland China to their online teaching in the aviation discipline.},

As a case study, we investigate reducing this knowledge barrier to allow consumers to achieve search effectiveness comparable to that of an expert, or a medical professional, for COVID-19 related questions. We introduce and evaluate a hybrid index model that allows a consumer to formulate queries using consumer language to find relevant answers to COVID-19 questions. Our aim is to reduce performance degradation between medical professional queries and those of a consumer. We use a universal sentence embedding model to project consumer queries into the same semantic space as professional queries. We then incorporate sentence embeddings into a search framework alongside an inverted index. Documents from this index are retrieved using a novel scoring function that considers sentence embeddings and BM25 scoring. We find that our framework alleviates the expertise disparity, which we validate using an additional set of crowdsourced—consumer—queries even in an unsupervised setting. We also propose an extension of our method, where the sentence encoder is optimised in a supervised setup. Our framework allows for a consumer to search using consumer queries to match the search performance with that of a professional.},

   abstract = {Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.},

   abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has been a driving force for a substantial increase in online activity and transactions across the globe. As a consequence, cyber-attacks, particularly those leveraging email as the preferred attack vector, have also increased exponentially since Q1 2020. Despite this, email remains a popular communication tool. Previously, in an effort to reduce the amount of spam entering a users inbox, many email providers started to incorporate spam filters into their products. However, many commercial spam filters rely on a human to train the filter, leaving a margin of risk if sufficient training has not occurred. In addition, knowing this, hackers employ more targeted and nuanced obfuscation methods to bypass in-built spam filters. In response to this continued problem, there is a growing body of research on the use of machine learning techniques for spam filtering. In many cases, detection results have shown great promise, but often still rely on human input to classify training datasets. In this study, we explore specifically the use of deep learning as a method of reducing human input required for spam detection. First, we evaluate the efficacy of popular spam detection methods/tools/techniques (freeware). Next, we narrow down machine learning techniques to select the appropriate method for our dataset. This was then compared with the accuracy of freeware spam detection tools to present our results. Our results showed that our deep learning model, based on simple word embedding and global max pooling (SWEM-max) had higher accuracy (98.41%) than both Thunderbird (95%) and Mailwasher (92%) which are based on Bayesian spam filtering. Finally, we postulate whether this improvement is enough to accept the removal of human input in spam email detection.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 can be fundamental to support clinical decision-making and optimize resources. The objective of our study is to identify among the routinely tested clinical and analytical parameters those that would allow us to determine patients with the highest risk of dying from COVID-19. Material and methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort multicentric study by consecutively, including hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted in any of the 11 hospitals in the healthcare network of HM Hospitals-Spain. We collected the clinical, demographic, analytical, and radiological data from the patient's medical records. To assess each of the biomarkers’ predictive impact and measure the statistical significance of the variables involved in the analysis, we applied a random forest with a permutation method. We used the similarity measure induced by a previously classification model and adjusted the k-groups clustering algorithm based on the energy distance to stratify patients into a high and low-risk group. Finally, we adjusted two optimal classification trees to have a schematic representation of the cut-off points. Results: We included 1246 patients (average age of 65.36 years, 62% males). During the study one hundred sixty-eight patients (13%) died. High values of age, D-Dimer, White Blood Cell, Na, CRP, and creatinine represent the factors that identify high-risk patients who would die. Conclusions: Age seems to be the primary predictor of mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the impact of acute phase reactants and blood cellularity is also highly relevant.},

People are facing unprecedented levels of intense threat, necessitating professional, systematic psychiatric intervention and assistance. New psychological services must be established as quickly as possible to support the mental healthcare needs of people in this pandemic condition. This study examines the contents of calls landed in the emergency response support system (ERSS) during the pandemic. Furthermore, a combined analysis of Twitter patterns connected to emergency services could be valuable in assisting people in this pandemic crisis and understanding and supporting people's emotions. The proposed Average Voting Ensemble Deep Learning model (AVEDL Model) is based on the Average Voting technique. The AVEDL Model is utilized to classify emotion based on COVID-19 associated emergency response support system calls (transcribed) along with tweets. Pre-trained transformer-based models BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa are combined to build the AVEDL Model, which achieves the best results. The AVEDL Model is trained and tested for emotion detection using the COVID-19 labeled tweets and call content of the emergency response support system. This is the first deep learning ensemble model using COVID-19 emotion analysis to the best of our knowledge. The AVEDL Model outperforms standard deep learning and machine learning models by attaining an accuracy of 86.46 percent and Macro-average F1-score of 85.20 percent.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an intuitive Python toolbox for Teaching Ensemble-based Data Assimilation (DA), TEDA. This toolbox responds to the necessity of having software for teaching and learning topics related to ensemble-based DA; this process can be critical to motivate undergraduate and graduate students towards scientific topics such as meteorological anomalies and climate change. Most DA toolboxes are related to operational software wherein the learning process of concepts and methods is not the main focus. TEDA facilitates the teaching and learning process of DA concepts via multiple plots of error statistics and by providing different perspectives of numerical results such as model errors, observational errors, error distributions, the time evolution of errors, ensemble-based DA, covariance matrix inflation, precision matrix estimation, and covariance localization methods, among others. By default, the toolbox is released with five well-known ensemble-based DA methods: the stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the dual EnKF formulation, the EnKF via Cholesky decomposition, the EnKF based on a modified Cholesky decomposition, and the EnKF based on B-localization. Besides, TEDA comes with three toy models: the Duffing equation (2 variables), the Lorenz 63 model (3 variables), and the Lorenz 96 model (40 variables), all of which exhibit chaotic behavior for some parameter configurations, which makes them attractive for testing DA methods. We develop the toolbox using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, which makes incorporating new techniques and models into the toolbox easy. We can simulate several DA scenarios for different configurations of models and methods to better understand how ensemble-based DA methods work.},

Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)-motivated full-skin bionic (FSB) e-skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis–dermis–hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e-skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa−1 (<1 kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa−1 (1–34 kPa), and fast response/recovery time of <5.6 ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a “brain”. First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis–dermis–hypodermis and a five-layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e-skin with a six-layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real-time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.},

   abstract = {The use of supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) cycles in waste heat to power (WHP) applications, specifically in combined-cycle power systems, can help industrial and power generation facilities save money and increase efficiency. According to the literature, the main hindrance facing the commercialization of these systems is their relative novelty compared to other well-established power systems like the steam and organic Rankine cycles. This thesis aims to reveal and present detailed economic and thermodynamic features and characteristics of these sCO2 power cycles to help increase the market stakeholders' confidence in such a new technology. Hence, accelerate its promotion and application in established facilities and new projects.Therefore, five main components were implemented and reported in this work: (1) Review and statistical analysis of a large pool of recently published academic articles and technical reports that have focused on the economic and technical performance of sCO2 power cycles when applied to waste heat recovery; (2) Implementing an economic analysis for a base-model and four selected case studies, including details usually overlooked in the literature. Also, performing an extensive sensitivity analysis for the base-model to give a holistic overview on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the specific investment cost (SIC) range of sCO2 bottoming cycles; (3) Exergoeconomic analysis and iterative optimization of selected sCO2 bottoming cycles to a fixed topping gas turbine (GT). Hence, revealing the main thermodynamic inefficiencies and identifying all possible measures that could be applied for cost reduction without any remarkable negative effects on the system performance; (4) Utilisation of a machine learning (ML) algorithm to demonstrate the benefits of applying predictiveanalytical IT solutions in optimization and selection of sCO2 bottoming cycle layouts while varying the topping gas turbine (three different GT sizes); (5) Also, as part of the economic analysis of sCO2 power cycles, three different market scenarios were developed for the first time using a "technology foresight" approach.The main outcomes that were concluded out of these five main study components were the following: (1) Out of 73 reviewed publications, 41 unique sCO2 bottoming cycle layouts were identified and categorised into five groups depending on the configuration and complexity of each cycle. A wide range of LCOE values (24 to 70 /MWhe) was identified and extracted from this reviewed literature; (2) The economic analysis helped estimate the investment cost of sCO2 bottoming cycles at a relatively low uncertainty range around +/-30%. Using different economic calculation methods showed a 30% variation in LCOE values of the base-model. Also, the sensitivity analysis showed the influence of varying the system variables on LCOE and SIC results of the base-model. Then, two estimation charts were developed and introduced to show the expected SIC, LCOE, and net power range from the four selected sCO2 bottoming cycles in relation to the base-model; (3) The iterative exergoeconomic optimization showed that most of the room available for improving the cost-effectiveness of the sCO2 bottoming cycle lies mainly in the design of its heaters and recuperators. Also, it revealed that the SIC of the system could be reduced much easier than its LCOE, while the rate of decrease in LCOE is slightly higher than the reduction in generated power; (4) The ML tool confirmed the relative superiority of the sCO2 partial heating and triple heating cycle layouts, yet this outcome depends on the topping GT size and the quality of the cycles generated by the ML algorithm. Also, implementing the fitness function for the ML algorithm using exergoeconomics helped achieve the optimal economic solutions of the sCO2 bottoming cycles at high accuracy; (5) Lastly, using the "technology foresight" approach, three possible future market scenarios for the sCO2 power cycle technology were developed and reported.},

One may therefore come across many definitions of what DT is and how to create it. DT can be designed for an existing process and help us to improve it. Another possible approach is to create the DT for a brand new device. In this case, it can reveal how the system would behave in given conditions or when controlled. One of purposes of a DT is to support the commissioning of devices. So far, recognized and used techniques to make the commissioning more effective are virtual commissioning and hybrid commissioning. In this article, we present a concept of hybrid virtual commissioning. This concept aims to point out the possibility to use real devices already at the stage of virtual commissioning. It is introduced in a practical case study of a robotic manipulator with machine vision controlled with a programmable logic controller in a pick-and-place application.

Wastewater-based surveillance for COVID-19 is still in its infancy. In particular, the quantitative link between clinical cases observed through traditional surveillance and the signals from viral concentrations in wastewater is still developing and hampers interpretation of the data and actionable public-health decisions. We present a modelling framework that includes both SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles in the sewage system after faecal shedding by infected persons in the population. Using our mechanistic representation of the combined clinical/wastewater system, we perform exploratory simulations to quantify the effect of surveillance effectiveness, public-health interventions and vaccination on the discordance between clinical and wastewater signals. We also apply our model to surveillance data from three Canadian cities to provide wastewater-informed estimates for the actual prevalence, the effective reproduction number and incidence forecasts. We find that wastewater-based surveillance, paired with this model, can complement clinical surveillance by supporting the estimation of key epidemiological metrics and hence better triangulate the state of an epidemic using this alternative data source.},

   abstract = {Pay-per-click advertising includes various formats (e.g., search, contextual, social) with a total investment of more than 200 billion USD per year worldwide. An advertiser is given a daily budget to allocate over several campaigns, mainly distinguishing for the ad, target, or channel. Furthermore, publishers choose the ads to display and how to allocate them employing auctioning mechanisms, in which, every day and for each campaign, the advertisers set a bid corresponding to the maximum amount of money per click they are willing to pay and the fraction of the daily budget to invest. In this paper, we study the problem of automating the online joint bid/daily budget optimization of pay-per-click advertising campaigns over multiple channels, and we face the challenging goal of designing techniques with theoretical guarantees that can be applied in real-world applications, where, commonly, data scarcity is a crucial issue. We formulate our problem as a combinatorial semi-bandit problem, which requires solving a special case of the Multiple-Choice Knapsack problem every day. Furthermore, we address data scarcity by designing a model for the dependency of the number of clicks on the bid and daily budget, requiring few parameters at the cost of mild regularity assumptions. We propose two algorithms—the first is randomized, while the second is deterministic—and show that they suffer from a regret that is upper bounded with high probability as O˜(T), where T is the time horizon of the learning process. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms with synthetic settings generated from real data provided by Yahoo!, and we present the results of adopting our algorithms in a real-world application with a daily spent of 1,000 Euros for more than one year.},

We find that vaccination campaigns that prioritize high-contact occupational groups achieve similar infection levels with half the number of vaccines, while also reducing and delaying peaks.

   abstract = {Purpose: The advent of clinically adapted machine learning algorithms can solve numerous problems ranging from disease diagnosis and prognosis to therapy recommendations. This systematic review examines the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms and evaluates the progress made to date towards their implementation in clinical practice. Methods: Systematic searching of databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and WHO Covid-19 database) to identify original articles published between January 2011 and October 2021. Studies reporting ML techniques in clinical practice involving humans and ML algorithms with a performance metric were considered. Results: Of 873 unique articles identified, 36 studies were eligible for inclusion. The XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) algorithm showed the highest potential for clinical applications (n = 7 studies); this was followed jointly by random forest algorithm, logistic regression, and the support vector machine, respectively (n = 5 studies). Prediction of outcomes (n = 33), in particular Inflammatory diseases (n = 7) received the most attention followed by cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders (n = 5 for each) and Covid-19 (n = 4). Thirty-three out of the thirty-six included studies passed more than 50% of the selected quality assessment criteria in the TRIPOD checklist. In contrast, none of the studies could achieve an ideal overall bias rating of ‘low’ based on the PROBAST checklist. In contrast, only three studies showed evidence of the deployment of ML algorithm(s) in clinical practice. Conclusions: ML is potentially a reliable tool for clinical decision support. Although advocated widely in clinical practice, work is still in progress to validate clinically adapted ML algorithms. Improving quality standards, transparency, and interpretability of ML models will further lower the barriers to acceptability.},

We have developed PyR0, a hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that infers relative prevalence of all viral lineages across geographic regions, detects lineages increasing in prevalence, and identifies mutations relevant to fitness. Applying PyR0 to all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we identify numerous substitutions that increase fitness, including previously identified spike mutations and many nonspike mutations within the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins. PyR0 forecasts growth of new lineages from their mutational profile, ranks the fitness of lineages as new sequences become available, and prioritizes mutations of biological and public health concern for functional characterization.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the significant value of systems modelling in supporting proactive and effective public health decision making despite the complexities and uncertainties that characterise an evolving crisis. The same approach is possible in the field of mental health. However, a commonly levelled (but misguided) criticism prevents systems modelling from being more routinely adopted, namely, that the presence of uncertainty around key model input parameters renders a model useless. This study explored whether radically different simulated trajectories of suicide would result in different advice to decision makers regarding the optimal strategy to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on mental health. Using an existing system dynamics model developed in August 2020 for a regional catchment of Western Australia, four scenarios were simulated to model the possible effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of psychological distress. The scenarios produced a range of projected impacts on suicide deaths, ranging from a relatively small to a dramatic increase. Discordance in the sets of best-performing intervention scenarios across the divergent COVID-mental health trajectories was assessed by comparing differences in projected numbers of suicides between the baseline scenario and each of 286 possible intervention scenarios calculated for two time horizons; 2026 and 2041. The best performing intervention combinations over the period 2021–2041 (i.e., post-suicide attempt assertive aftercare, community support programs to increase community connectedness, and technology enabled care coordination) were highly consistent across all four COVID-19 mental health trajectories, reducing suicide deaths by between 23.9–24.6% against the baseline. However, the ranking of best performing intervention combinations does alter depending on the time horizon under consideration due to non-linear intervention impacts. These findings suggest that systems models can retain value in informing robust decision making despite uncertainty in the trajectories of population mental health outcomes. It is recommended that the time horizon under consideration be sufficiently long to capture the full effects of interventions, and efforts should be made to achieve more timely tracking and access to key population mental health indicators to inform model refinements over time and reduce uncertainty in mental health policy and planning decisions.},

Studies of how the interactions between parcels of genetic information can change as a function of environmental context have added a layer of complexity to these discussions. Here, I introduce the “mutation effect reaction norm” (Mu-RN), a new instrument through which one can analyze the phenotypic consequences of mutations and interactions across environmental contexts. It embodies the fusion of measurements of genetic interactions with the reaction norm, a classic depiction of the performance of genotypes across environments. I demonstrate the utility of the Mu-RN through a case study: the signature of a “compensatory ratchet” mutation that undermines reverse evolution of antimicrobial resistance. In closing, I argue that the mutation effect reaction norm may help us resolve the dynamism and unpredictability of evolution, with implications for theoretical biology, biotechnology, and public health.},

Based on RMSE values, k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine algorithms were found to be the best for predicting future incidences of COVID-19 based on past histories. From the RMSE values obtained, temperature was found to be the best predictor for number of COVID-19 cases, followed by relative humidity. Decision tree models was found to perform poorly in the prediction of COVID-19 cases considering particulate matter and atmospheric parameters as predictors.

   abstract = {Monitoring the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is necessary to make informed public health decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. PCR assays have received global attention, facilitating rapid understanding of variant dynamics because they are more accessible and scalable than genome sequencing. However, as PCR assays target only a few mutations, their accuracy could be compromised when these mutations are not exclusive to target variants. Here we show how to design variant-specific PCR assays with high sensitivity and specificity across different geographical regions by incorporating sequences deposited in the GISAID database. Furthermore, we demonstrate that several previously developed PCR assays have decreased accuracy outside their study areas. We introduce PRIMES, an algorithm that enables the design of reliable PCR assays, as demonstrated in our experiments to track dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in local sewage samples. Our findings will contribute to improving PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance.Importance Monitoring the introduction and prevalence of variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) in a community can help the local authorities make informed public health decisions. PCR assays can be designed to keep track of SARS-CoV-2 variants by measuring unique mutation markers that are exclusive to the target variants. However, the mutation markers can not be exclusive to the target variants depending on regional and temporal differences in variant dynamics. We introduce PRIMES, an algorithm that enables the design of reliable PCR assays for variant detection. Because PCR is more accessible, scalable, and robust to sewage samples over sequencing technology, our findings will contribute to improving global SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Grainger College of Engineering and the JUMP-ARCHES program of OSF Healthcare in conjunction with the University of Illinois.

We estimate their effect on vaccine uptake for France, Germany, and Italy using counterfactuals constructed via innovation diffusion theory. The announcement of COVID certificates during summer 2021 were associated – although causality cannot be directly inferred – with increased vaccine uptake in France of 13.0 (95% CI 9.7–14.9) percentage points (p.p.) of the total population until the end of the year, in Germany 6.2 (2.6–6.9) p.p., and in Italy 9.7 (5.4–12.3) p.p. Based on these estimates, an additional 3979 (3453–4298) deaths in France, 1133 (−312–1358) in Germany, and 1331 (502–1794) in Italy were averted; and gross domestic product (GDP) losses of €6.0 (5.9–6.1) billion in France, €1.4 (1.3–1.5) billion in Germany, and €2.1 (2.0–2.2) billion in Italy were prevented.

   abstract = {<p>Nowadays, we are facing the worldwide pandemic caused by COVID-19. The complexity and momentum of monitoring patients infected with this virus calls for the usage of agile and scalable data structure methodologies. OpenEHR is a healthcare standard that is attracting a lot of attention in recent years due to its comprehensive and robust architecture. The importance of an open, standardized and adaptable approach to clinical data lies in extracting value to generate useful knowledge that really can help healthcare professionals make an assertive decision. This importance is even more accentuated when facing a pandemic context. Thus, in this study, a system for tracking symptoms and health conditions of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients from a Portuguese hospital was developed using openEHR. All data on the evolutionary status of patients in home care as well as the results of their COVID-19 test were used to train different ML algorithms, with the aim of developing a predictive model capable of identifying COVID-19 infections according to the severity of symptoms identified by patients. The CRISP-DM methodology was used to conduct this research. The results obtained were promising, with the best model achieving an accuracy of 96.25%, a precision of 99.91%, a sensitivity of 92.58%, a specificity of 99.92%, and an AUC of 0.963, using the Decision Tree algorithm and the Split Validation method. Hence, in the future, after further testing, the predictive model could be implemented in clinical decision support systems.</p>},

   abstract = {The accurate detection of the mobile context information of public transportation vehicles and their passengers is a key feature to realize intelligent transportation systems. A topical example is in-vehicle presence detection that can, e.g., be used to ticket passengers automatically. Unfortunately, most existing solutions in this field suffer from low spatiotemporal accuracy which impedes their use in practice. In previous work, we addressed this challenge through a deep learning-based framework, called DEEPMATCH, that allows us to detect in-vehicle presence with a high degree of accuracy. DEEPMATCH utilizes the smartphone of a passenger to analyse and match the event streams of its own sensors with the event streams of counterpart sensors provided by a reference unit that is installed inside the vehicle. This is achieved through a new learning model architecture using Stacked Convolutional Autoencoders to compress sensor input streams by feature extraction and dimensionality reduction as well as a deep convolutional neural network to match the streams of the user phone and the reference device. The sensor stream compression is offloaded to the smartphone, while the matching is performed in a server. In this paper, we introduce DEEPMATCH2. It is an amended version of DEEPMATCH that reduces the amount of data to be transferred from the user and reference devices to the server by the factor of four. Further, DEEPMATCH2 improves the already good accuracy of DEEPMATCH from 97.81% to 98.51%. Moreover, we propose a travel inference algorithm, based on DEEPMATCH2, to detect the duration of whole passenger trips in public transport vehicles with a high degree of precision. This is needed to create intelligent and highly reliable auto-ticketing systems. Thanks to the high accuracy of 98.51% by DEEPMATCH2, the inferences can be carried out with a negligible error rate.},

This work presents a data collection methodology for responsible AI in Health and a case study in the pregnancy domain. It is a qualitative descriptive study on the preferences and expectations expressed by pregnant women regarding responsible AI and affective computing. A 41-items structured interview was distributed among 150 pregnant pa- tients attending prenatal care at Hospital Virgen del Rocío and the Clinic Victoria Rey (Seville, Spain) during the months of October and November 2020. A substantial interest in intelligent pregnancy solutions among pregnant women has been revealed in this study. Participants with a lower level of interest reported privacy concerns and lack of trust towards AI solutions. Re- garding affective computing based intelligent solutions specifically, most participants reported positively and no significant difference was found between women having a healthy or a high risk pregnancy on this matter. Our findings also suggest that a high demand of personalized intelligent solutions exists among participants. On the topic of sharing pregnancy data with the healthcare provider in favor of scientific research, pregnant women assisting public health- care services were found to be more likely to share their data when the provider was a public healthcare system rather than a private entity. Pregnant women who are interested in using an AI pregnancy application share a strong idea that it needs to be responsible, trustworthy, useful, and safe. Likewise, we found that pregnant women would change their mind about their concerns and they would feel more confident if the intelligent solution gives explanations about the system decisions and recommendations, as XAI approach promotes.},

   abstract = {The classifier selection problem in Assistive Technology Adoption refers to selecting the classification algorithms that have the best performance in predicting the adoption of technology, and is often addressed through measuring different single performance indicators. Satisfactory clas-sifier selection can help in reducing time and costs involved in the technology adoption process. As there are multiple criteria from different domains and several candidate classification algorithms, the classifier selection process is now a problem that can be addressed using Multiple-Criteria De-cision-Making (MCDM) methods. This paper proposes a novel approach to address the classifier selection problem by integrating Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFS), Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The step-by-step procedure behind this application is as follows. First, IF-DE-MATEL was used for estimating the criteria and sub-criteria weights considering uncertainty. This method was also employed to evaluate the interrelations among classifier selection criteria. Finally, a modified TOPSIS was applied to generate an overall suitability index per classifier so that the most effective ones can be selected. The proposed approach was validated using a real-world case study concerning the adoption of a mobile-based reminding solution by People with Dementia (PwD). The outputs allow public health managers to accurately identify whether PwD can adopt an assistive technology which results in (i) reduced cost overruns due to wrong classification, (ii) improved quality of life of adopters, and (iii) rapid deployment of intervention alternatives for non-adopters.},

Models generated from three different AI algorithms have been studied: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. Two open-access image datasets were used in this study. In the first one, a dataset composed of paediatric chest X-ray, the best performing generated models achieved an 83.3% accuracy with 89% sensitivity for radiomics, 89.9% accuracy with 93.6% sensitivity for fractal dimension and 91.3% accuracy with 90.5% sensitivity for superpixels based histon. Second, a dataset derived from an image repository developed primarily as a tool for studying COVID-19 was used. For this dataset, the best performing generated models resulted in a 95.3% accuracy with 99.2% sensitivity for radiomics, 99% accuracy with 100% sensitivity for fractal dimension and 99% accuracy with 98.6% sensitivity for superpixel-based histons. The results confirm the validity of the tested methods as reliable and easy-to-implement automatic diagnostic tools for pneumonia.},

   abstract = {Since 2020, the world is still facing a global economic and health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One approach to fighting this global crisis is to track COVID-19 cases by wireless technologies, which requires receiving reliable, efficient, and accurate data. Consequently, this article proposes a model based on Lagrange optimization and a distributed deep learning model to assure that all required data for tracking any suspected COVID-19 patient is received efficiently and reliably. Finding the optimum location of the Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) reader relevant to the base station results in the reliable transmission of data. The proposed deep learning model, developed using the one-dimensional convolutional neural network and a fully connected network, resulted in lower mean absolute squared errors when compared to state-of-the-art regression bench-marks. The proposed model based on Lagrange optimization and deep learning algorithms is evaluated when changing different network parameters, such as requiring signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio, reader transmission power, and the required system quality-of-service. The analysis of the obtained results, which indicates the appropriate transmission distance between an RFID reader and a base station, shows the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed approach, which leads to an easy and efficient tracking system.},

   abstract = {<p>Objective. Internet of Things (IoT) integrates several technologies where devices learn from the experience of each other thereby reducing human-intervened likely errors. Modern technologies like IoT and machine learning enable the conventional to patient-specific approach transition in healthcare. In conventional approach, the biggest challenge faced by healthcare professionals is to predict a disease by observing the symptoms, monitoring the remote area patient, and also attending to the patient all the time after being hospitalised. IoT provides real-time data, makes decision-making smarter, and provides far superior analytics, and all these to help improve the quality of healthcare. The main objective of the work was to create an IoT-based automated system using machine learning models for symptom-based COVID-19 prognosis. Methods. Comparative analysis of predictive microbiology of COVID-19 from case symptoms using various machine learning classifiers like logistics regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest, decision trees, Naïve Bayes, and gradient booster is reported here. For the sake of the validation and verification of the models, performance of each model based on the retrieved cloud-stored data was measured for accuracy. Results. From the accuracy plot, it was concluded that k-NN was more accurate (97.97%) followed by decision tree (97.79), support vector machine (97.42), logistics regression (96.50), random forest (90.66), gradient boosting classifier (87.77), and Naïve Bayes (73.50) in COVID-19 prognosis. Conclusion. The paper presents a health monitoring IoT framework having high clinical significance in real-time and remote healthcare monitoring. The findings reported here and the lessons learnt shall enable the healthcare system worldwide to counter not only this ongoing COVID but many other such global pandemics the humanity may suffer from time to come.</p>},

   abstract = {Background: Although decision-makers in health care settings need to read and understand the validity of quantitative reports, they do not always carefully read information on research methods. Presenting the methods in a more structured way could improve the time spent reading the methods and increase the perceived relevance of this important report section. Objective: To test the effect of a structured summary of the methods used in a quantitative data report on reading behavior with eye-tracking and measure the effect on the perceived importance of this section. Methods: A nonrandomized pilot trial was performed in a computer laboratory setting with advanced medical students. All participants were asked to read a quantitative data report; an intervention arm was also shown a textbox summarizing key features of the methods used in the report. Three data-collection methods were used to document reading behavior and the views of participants: eye-tracking (during reading), a written questionnaire, and a face-to-face interview. Results: We included 35 participants, 22 in the control arm and 13 in the intervention arm. The overall time spent reading the methods did not differ between the 2 arms. The intervention arm considered the information in the methods section to be less helpful for decision-making than did the control arm (scores for perceived helpfulness were 4.1 and 2.9, respectively, range 1-10). Participants who read the box more intensively tended to spend more time on the methods as a whole (Pearson correlation 0.81, P=.001). Conclusions: Adding a structured summary of information on research methods attracted attention from most participants, but did not increase the time spent on reading the methods or lead to increased perceptions that the methods section was helpful for decision-making. Participants made use of the summary to quickly judge the methods, but this did not increase the perceived relevance of this section.},

   abstract = {Different from large-scale platforms such as Taobao and Amazon, CVR modeling in small-scale recommendation scenarios is more challenging due to the severe Data Distribution Fluctuation (DDF) issue. DDF prevents existing CVR models from being effective since 1) several months of data are needed to train CVR models sufficiently in small scenarios, leading to considerable distribution discrepancy between training and online serving; and 2) e-commerce promotions have significant impacts on small scenarios, leading to distribution uncertainty of the upcoming time period. In this work, we propose a novel CVR method named MetaCVR from a perspective of meta learning to address the DDF issue. Firstly, a base CVR model which consists of a Feature Representation Network (FRN) and output layers is designed and trained sufficiently with samples across months. Then we treat time periods with different data distributions as different occasions and obtain positive and negative prototypes for each occasion using the corresponding samples and the pre-trained FRN. Subsequently, a Distance Metric Network (DMN) is devised to calculate the distance metrics between each sample and all prototypes to facilitate mitigating the distribution uncertainty. At last, we develop an Ensemble Prediction Network (EPN) which incorporates the output of FRN and DMN to make the final CVR prediction. In this stage, we freeze the FRN and train the DMN and EPN with samples from recent time period, therefore effectively easing the distribution discrepancy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of CVR prediction targeting the DDF issue in small-scale recommendation scenarios. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the superiority of our MetaCVR and online A/B test also shows our model achieves impressive gains of 11.92% on PCVR and 8.64% on GMV.},

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely stressed the sanitary systems of all countries in the world. One of the main issues that physicians are called to tackle is represented by the monitoring of pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 patients at home and, generally speaking, everyone the access to the hospital might or should be severely reduced. Indeed, the early detection of interstitial pneumonia is particularly relevant for the survival of these patients. Recent studies on rheumatoid arthritis and interstitial lung diseases have shown that pathological pulmonary sounds can be automatically detected by suitably developed algorithms. The scope of this preliminary work consists of proving that the pathological lung sounds evidenced in patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia can be automatically detected as well by the same class of algorithms. In particular the software VECTOR, suitably devised for interstitial lung diseases, has been employed to process the lung sounds of 28 patient recorded in the emergency room at the university hospital of Modena (Italy) during December 2020. The performance of VECTOR has been compared with diagnostic techniques based on imaging, namely lung ultrasound, chest X-ray and high resolution computed tomography, which have been assumed as ground truth. The results have evidenced a surprising overall diagnostic accuracy of 75% even if the staff of the emergency room has not been suitably trained for lung auscultation and the parameters of the software have not been optimized to detect interstitial pneumonia. These results pave the way to a new approach for monitoring the pulmonary implication in pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 patients.},

   abstract = {Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction is a critical and challenging component across different safety–critical engineering applications, e.g., autonomous driving and flight systems. Trajectory prediction tools are required for the next-generation air transportation system (NextGen). In practice, the prediction of aircraft trajectories needs to consider the impact of various sources, such as environmental conditions, pilot/controller behaviors, and potential conflicts with nearby aircraft. Huge uncertainties associated with these factors lead to the untrustworthiness of a deterministic trajectory prediction model. Moreover, the safety assurance in the near-terminal area is of specific interest due to the increased airspace complexity, where the instrument/visual flight rules are applied. In this work, we propose the Bayesian Spatio-Temporal grAph tRansformer (B-STAR) architecture to model the spatial and temporal relationship of multiple agents under uncertainties. It is shown that the proposed B-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ETH/UCY pedestrian dataset with UQ competence. Then, multi-aircraft near-terminal interactive trajectory prediction model is trained and validated with real-world flight recording data. The sensitivity study on the prediction/observation horizon and the graph neighboring distance threshold are performed.

   abstract = {We introduce the forecasting technology behind Composable Finance's (Composable's)1 cross-layer cross-chain bridge Mosaic2 . Mosaic contains a network of vaults, one on each layer and chain, and we present our research into improving the operation and robustness of said bridge via liquidity forecasting of its associated vaults. Users utilize the bridge to transfer assets from a source network and source layer (a source vault) to a destination network and layer (a destination vault). However, if a vault is near depletion when a transfer is initiated the transfer can fail due to inefficient liquidity. Thus, critical to maximizing the user experience of Mosaic is being able to forecast accurately when the liquidity will be depleted from vaults supported by Mosaic. After introducing Mosaic, and without loss of generality, we forecast liquidity movements between three vaults: one on the layer 1 (L1) Ethereum mainnet, one on the L2 Polygon (POL) network, and one on the L2 Arbitrum (ARB) network. We demonstrate state of the art results from our statistical and AI methods that can consistently achieve low average errors (e.g., &lt;2% liquidity) and high coverage (e.g., &gt;80%) of the true liquidity levels in their 1-week-ahead forecast confidence intervals. As a baseline, we first develop autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for forecasting. The ARIMA models are optimized at each time step and provide conservative confidence intervals that allow us to safely assess the times when vaults will reach critical liquidity values and therefore, prevent depletion. To further enhance our forecasting framework, we also develop a machine learning approach with Gaussian Processes that can further capture time series trends, past replenishment events, where large discontinuities are present. Liquidity data for our forecasting methodologies will be provided in two levels of fidelity. We first introduce our in-house Liquidity Simulation Environment (LSE) - a state machine capable of running hypothetical vault liquidity scenarios under certain assumed cross-layer trades/swaps. Next, we forecast real-world data obtained from a recent PoC three-vault bridge setup run by Composable, and we apply the LSE to that. Finally, we provide our thoughts on forecasting beyond the PoC - our work will be of interest to layer 1, layer 2, cross-layer cross-chain, and AI researchers working on DeFi and blockchain technologies.},

This paper proposed a novel framework for personal health record (PHR) management using IBM cloud data lake and blockchain platform for an effective healthcare management process. The problem in the blockchain-based healthcare management system can be minimized with the utilization of the proposed technique. Significantly, the traditional blockchain system usually decreases the latency. Therefore, the proposed technique focuses on improving latency and throughput. The result of the proposed system is calculated based on various matrices, such as F1 Score, Recall, and Confusion matrices. Therefore, the proposed work scored high accuracy and provided better results than existing techniques.},

   abstract = {The presence of sensing and actuating equipment faults in Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems may result in unsatisfactory indoor thermal conditions and significant wasted energy in the building sector. The design of fault diagnosis algorithms for multi-zone buildings is a highly challenging procedure due to the overall complexity of the system. This paper proposes a distributed model-based fault diagnosis algorithm for detecting, isolating and identifying faults that can affect the actuating devices of Air Handling Units (AHUs) and the sensor devices. Based on modeling the temperature dynamics of each local AHU and its underlying zone with respect to its neighboring zones, a local fault diagnosis agent that collects local control signals and local and neighboring sensor measurements is designed. Each local diagnosis agent is designed to estimate on-line the states of each AHU. For each estimation, a residual signal is derived that corresponds to the difference between the measured and estimated value at each time step. Considering healthy conditions, the residual is bounded by its corresponding adaptive threshold that is calculated considering the effects of modeling uncertainties. Each corresponding pair of residual and adaptive threshold forms an analytical redundancy relation which indicates the possible presence of one or more faults. Exploiting the dependency of each actuator and sensor fault with each Analytical Redundancy Relation (ARR), a decision logic is designed, that can reveal under certain conditions the location and type of the fault during the operation of the system. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using a simulation example of a primary school building with 25 zones.},

It also eliminates those molecules which are not supposed to cross the barrier, as doing so would lead to toxicity. BBBP can be measured in vivo, in vitro or in silico. With the advent and subsequent rise of in silico methods for virtual drug screening, quite a bit of work has been done to predict this feature using statistical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based methods. In this work a mixed DL-based model, consisting of a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network layers, has been paired with Mol2vec. Mol2vec is a convenient and unsupervised machine learning technique which produces high-dimensional vector representations of molecules and its molecular substructures. These succinct vector representations are utilized as inputs to the mixed DL model that is used for BBBP predictions. Several well-known benchmarks incorporating BBBP data have been used for supervised training and prediction by our mixed DL model which demonstrates superior results when compared to existing ML and DL techniques used for predicting BBBP.},

   abstract = {Background: Traditional monitoring for adverse events following immunization (AEFI) relies on various established reporting systems, where there is inevitable lag between an AEFI occurring and its potential reporting and subsequent processing of reports. AEFI safety signal detection strives to detect AEFI as early as possible, ideally close to real time. Monitoring social media data holds promise as a resource for this. Objective: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the utility of monitoring social media for gaining early insights into vaccine safety issues, by extracting vaccine adverse event mentions (VAEMs) from Twitter, using natural language processing techniques. The secondary aims are to document the natural language processing techniques used and identify the most effective of them for identifying tweets that contain VAEM, with a view to define an approach that might be applicable to other similar social media surveillance tasks. Methods: A VAEM-Mine method was developed that combines topic modeling with classification techniques to extract maximal VAEM posts from a vaccine-related Twitter stream, with high degree of confidence. The approach does not require a targeted search for specific vaccine reaction–indicative words, but instead, identifies VAEM posts according to their language structure. Results: The VAEM-Mine method isolated 8992 VAEMs from 811,010 vaccine-related Twitter posts and achieved an F1 score of 0.91 in the classification phase. Conclusions: Social media can assist with the detection of vaccine safety signals as a valuable complementary source for monitoring mentions of vaccine adverse events. A social media–based VAEM data stream can be assessed for changes to detect possible emerging vaccine safety signals, helping to address the well-recognized limitations of passive reporting systems, including lack of timeliness and underreporting.},

   abstract = {Over the last decade, supply chain finance (SCF) has gained popularity and increasing attention among academicians and stakeholders in the context of financial flows in the supply chain. However, some research gaps still exist that need to be explored to improve the sustainability of supply chains. Specifically, there is a critical research need to look at the conceptual background of SCF and its potential applicability in various phases of supply chains. Therefore, this article aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive State-of-the-Art literature review based on 367 papers published from 2006 to 2020. Furthermore, this article is one of the first attempts to present current and past studies in the domain of SCF in a holistic manner. The analysis highlights the most influential authors, keywords, organisations, leading publications and clusters in existing research areas. This article also sets out a proposed research framework based on the triangulation approach perspective, that is, financial perspective, buyer perspective and supply chain-oriented perspective. The most important and unique contribution of the article is the identification of new and emerging research areas where the application of SCF is still in the nascent stage. These findings can guide stakeholders at every stage of the value chain to appropriately use techniques that model policies to better inform investment and operational decisions in line with Sustainable Development Goals.},

   abstract = {Existing research on making sense of deep neural networks often focuses on neuron-level interpretation, which may not adequately capture the bigger picture of how concepts are collectively encoded by multiple neurons. We present Neurocartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. Neurocartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting “dog faces” of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting “dog face” and “dog tail” are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs' relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. Neurocartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system's tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts. The Neurocartography visualization runs in modern browsers and is open-sourced.},

   abstract = {Context – The automotive industry is in the midst of a new reality where software is increasingly becoming the primary tool for delivering value to customers. While this has vastly improved their product offerings, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly facing the need to continuously develop, test, and deliver functionality, while maintaining high levels of quality. One important tool for achieving this is simulation-based testing where the external operating environment of a software system is simulated, enabling incremental development with rapid test feedback. However, the traditional practice of manually specifying simulation models for complex external environments involves immense engineering effort, while remaining vulnerable to inevitable assumptions and simplifications. Exploiting the increased availability of data that captures operational environments and scenarios from the field, this work takes a deep learning approach to train models that realistically simulate external environments, significantly increasing the credibility of simulation-driven software development.Contributions – First, focusing on simulating the input dependencies of automotive software functions, this work uses techniques of deep generative modeling to develop a framework for realistic test stimulus generation. Such models are trained self-supervised using recorded time-series field data and simulate the input environment much more credibly than manually specified models. With the credibility of stimulus generation being an important concern, an important concept of similarity as plausibility is introduced to evaluate the quality of generation during model training. Second, this work develops new techniques for sampling generative models that enable the controlled generation of test stimulus. Allowing testers to limit the range of scenarios considered for testing, the Metric-based Linear Interpolation (MLERP) sampling algorithm automatically chooses test stimuli that are verifiably similar to a user-supplied reference, and therefore measurably credible. While controllability eases the design of tests, credibility increases trust in the testing process. Third, recognizing that sampling may be an inefficient process for stimulus generation, this work develops a technique that extracts properties from actual code under test in order to automatically search for appropriate test stimuli within the specified range of test scenarios. Fourth, further addressing the question of credible stimulus generation, this work introduces techniques that examine training data for biases in sample representation. Overall, by taking a data-driven deep learning approach, techniques and tools developed in this work vastly expands the credibility of incremental automotive software development under simulated conditions.Future work – Work in the future plans to (1) expand the scope from openloop stimulus generation to include output dependencies including elements of feedback in closed-loop software systems, and (2) use trained models, instead of hand-coded rules, to understand and extract properties from code under test.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented new challenges surrounding end-of-life planning and has been associated with increased online discussion about life support. Research Question: How has online communication about advance care planning (ACP) and specific life-sustaining interventions (LSIs) changed during the pandemic? Study Design and Methods: Conversations on Twitter containing references to LSIs (eg, “ECMO”) or ACP (eg, “DNR/DNI”) were collected between January 2019 and May 2021. User account metadata were used to predict user demographic information and to classify users as organizations, individuals, clinicians, or influencers. The number of impressions was compared across these user categories and the content of tweets analyzed by using natural language processing models to identify topics of discussion and associated emotional sentiment. Results: There were 202,585 unique tweets about LSIs and 67,162 unique tweets about ACP. Users who were younger, male, or influencers were more likely to discuss LSIs online. Tweets about LSIs were associated with more positive emotional sentiment scores than tweets about ACP (LSIs, 0.3; ACP, –0.2; P < .001). Among tweets about ACP, most contained personal experiences related to the death of loved ones (27%) or discussed discrimination through do-not-resuscitate orders directed at the elderly and disabled (19%). Personal experiences had the greatest retweet-to-tweet-ratio (4.7), indicating high levels of user engagement. Tweets about discrimination contained the most negative net sentiment score (–0.5). Interpretation: The observed increase in tweets regarding LSIs and ACP suggests that Twitter was consistently used to discuss treatment modalities and preferences related to intensive care during the pandemic. Future interventions to increase online engagement with ACP may consider leveraging influencers and personal stories. Finally, we identified do-not-resuscitate-related discrimination as a commonly held public fear, which should be further explored as a barrier to ACP completion and can be proactively addressed by clinicians during bedside goals-of-care discussions.},

   abstract = {Fake news is a widespread menace that has instigated social unrest globally. Traditionally, AI models for fake news detection are based on linguistic clues, social media analysis, and/or pattern learning. Although these methods are powerful, they cannot be applied to real-world scenarios due to individual shortcomings such as confirmation bias and legal obligations such as freedom of expression. Further, compelling misleading and manipulated articles with journalistic writing style are being generated either manually or by using sophisticated deep learning technologies. Therefore, there is a need to go beyond simple binary classification and focus on nuanced judgments of the content veracity, like false, partially true, true, etc. This process is called fact-checking.It is problematic that there are a very small number of fact-checking organizations globally compared to the volume of content produced daily. The speed at which disinformation spreads online limits the ability of manual fact-checking websites which are resource-constrained. Automating any part of the fact-checking process can help reduce the time it takes to identify and respond to a claim and enable human fact-checkers time to focus on the more complex fact-checking that requires human judgment. Additionally, since fake news is a social concern, it is desirable to provide rationale on the automated decisions which is a challenge using black-box models. A solution with quality indicators can not only help support the model's decision but also assist manual fact-checkers - expert or non-expert - in quickly understanding the quality of information.With this motivation, we build an integrated framework for automated fact-checking, which includes three major tasks: (Task 1) using linguistic clues and pattern learning to segregate news articles into broad categories like "fake" and "real"; "clickbait" and "non-clickbait"; "disinformation", "hoax" and "propaganda" etc.; (Task 2) key claim identification in disinformation articles, where claims are statements important to the point of the article, but require verification; (Task 3) automatic verification which leverages credible sources to determine the veracity and produce evidence refuting/supporting key claims.We develop various algorithms in the neural embedding space using a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning for each of these tasks. The techniques developed in this dissertation allow us to study these tasks in isolation before integrating them together. For example, before building models for Task 1, we first perform linguistic and psycholinguistic studies to understand the intent and biases present in the mainstream and disinformation news text. This study provides an insight into the type of indicators that would help or would not help in identifying disinformation using the learning models. Further, Task 2 (claim identification) is traditionally dependent on sentence-level human annotations which is an expensive and time-consuming task, and mostly subject to personal bias. We introduce a novel approach to overcome this human dependency by demonstrating the effectiveness of using headline and summary of the article to identify check-worthy claim sentences. For Task 3, we introduce a novel dataset on two notable topics - politics and health - containing articles labeled with the degree of veracity based on evidence from the web. From the modeling perspective, the sub-tasks involve entity extraction from the written text, relevant information retrieval from the web, and context-based reasoning using attention-based language models.Methods described in this dissertation are designed to overcome data and time-induced biases in evidence-based veracity prediction. The quality indicators can be integrated into downstream tasks like fact-checking political debates/speeches, ranking information, moderating forums, etc. More importantly, this work represents a scalable approach to disinformation detection in conversational settings, especially in social media, and can be extended to other languages, topics, and countries. Multi-modality and active learning are also future avenues that one could look at to integrate with the system proposed in this work.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the IoT has emerged as the most promising technology in the key evolution of industry 4.0/industry 5.0, smart home automation (SHA), smart cities, energy savings and many other areas of wireless communication. There is a massively growing number of static and mobile IoT devices with a diversified range of speed and bandwidth, along with a growing demand for high data rates, which makes the network denser and more complicated. In this context, the next-generation communication technology, i.e., sixth generation (6G), is trying to build up the base to meet the imperative need of future network deployment. This article adopts the vision for 6G IoT systems and proposes an IoT-based real-time location monitoring system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for underground communication applications. An application-based analysis of industrial positioning systems is also presented.},

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted healthcare systems across the world. Chest radiography (CXR) can be used as a complementary method for diagnosing/following COVID-19 patients. However, experience level and workload of technicians and radiologists may affect the decision process. Recent studies suggest that deep learning can be used to assess CXRs, providing an important second opinion for radiologists and technicians in the decision process, and super-human performance in detection of COVID-19 has been reported in multiple studies. In this study, the clinical applicability of deep learning systems for COVID-19 screening was assessed by testing the performance of deep learning systems for the detection of COVID-19. Specifically, four datasets were used: (1) a collection of multiple public datasets (284.793 CXRs); (2) BIMCV dataset (16.631 CXRs); (3) COVIDGR (852 CXRs) and 4) a private dataset (6.361 CXRs). All datasets were collected retrospectively and consist of only frontal CXR views. A ResNet-18 was trained on each of the datasets for the detection of COVID-19. It is shown that a high dataset bias was present, leading to high performance in intradataset train-test scenarios (area under the curve 0.55–0.84 on the collection of public datasets). Significantly lower performances were obtained in interdataset train-test scenarios however (area under the curve > 0.98). A subset of the data was then assessed by radiologists for comparison to the automatic systems. Finetuning with radiologist annotations significantly increased performance across datasets (area under the curve 0.61–0.88) and improved the attention on clinical findings in positive COVID-19 CXRs. Nevertheless, tests on CXRs from different hospital services indicate that the screening performance of CXR and automatic systems is limited (area under the curve < 0.6 on emergency service CXRs). However, COVID-19 manifestations can be accurately detected when present, motivating the use of these tools for evaluating disease progression on mild to severe COVID-19 patients.},

A prediction model for PAs could help clinicians and patients monitor, control, and carry out early intervention for recurrent PAs, enabling more personalized treatment for panic disorder (PD). Objective: This study aims to provide a 7-day PA prediction model and determine the relationship between a future PA and various features, including physiological factors, anxiety and depressive factors, and the air quality index (AQI). Methods: We enrolled 59 participants with PD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview). Participants used smartwatches (Garmin Vívosmart 4) and mobile apps to collect their sleep, heart rate (HR), activity level, anxiety, and depression scores (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state anxiety [STAI-S], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety [STAI-T], and Panic Disorder Severity Scale Self-Report) in their real life for a duration of 1 year. We also included AQIs from open data. To analyze these data, our team used 6 machine learning methods: random forests, decision trees, linear discriminant analysis, adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and regularized greedy forests. Results: For 7-day PA predictions, the random forest produced the best prediction rate. Overall, the accuracy of the test set was 67.4%-81.3% for different machine learning algorithms. The most critical variables in the model were questionnaire and physiological features, such as the BAI, BDI, STAI, MINI, average HR, resting HR, and deep sleep duration. Conclusions: It is possible to predict PAs using a combination of data from questionnaires and physiological and environmental data.},

   abstract = {This article addresses the questions of what role international economic law has played in the story of digital inequality’s emergence and evolution and how international economic law can reduce digital inequality instead of enhancing it. The first part of this study illustrates the uneasy interplay between digital inequality and international economic law. At the network layer, the economic benefit of the General Agreement on Trade in Services’ Mode 3 (foreign investment) market access commitments in the telecommunications sector has never been realized in many developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). There is a missing link between the consequences of trade liberalization and broadband investment. At the application layer, today’s platformization of services was an ‘unforeseen development’ at the time the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established. Through the pro-liberalization of WTO jurisprudence, members’ decades-old Mode 1 (cross-border) market access commitments have played more than a marginal legal role in global datafication. The second part of this study discusses how international economic law can confront and potentially redress that inequality. In the context of trade and development, it remains to be seen how the WTO members can find the common ground needed to balance digital trade liberalization and development needs. Unless infrastructure concerns from developing countries and LDCs are addressed, the ongoing WTO e-commerce trade deal may end up being labelled the Digital ‘Haves’ Trade Agreement. In the context of trade and competition, the increasing inequality in digital platforms calls for a set of international competition rules to appropriately address market power in the data sector. By imposing cross-border disciplines for competition policy and thus curbing the power of big digital platforms, the proposed WTO Data Reference Paper may well be an effective instrument to address the second dimension of ‘digital inequality’ – data colonization.},

This paper explores upcoming trends in the LMD sector using a Delphi-based scenario study for 2040. We develop projections of future consumer behavior, delivery technologies, delivery services, and regulation to validate them by conducting a two-round Delphi study among 36 experts from the LMD industry, academia, and politics. Based on the results, three future scenarios are identified by fuzzy c-means clustering, set within the context of innovation diffusion theory and the technology acceptance model. There is expert consensus on the scope of technologies that will be used in 2040 and how consumers’ preferences may change, but the future design of delivery services is less certain. The identified scenarios provide managerial and policy guidance for logistics service providers, suppliers, municipalities, and e-commerce retailers to adapt their long-term strategies.},

Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics.},

   abstract = {In two experimental studies, we tested the effect of COVID-19 vaccine scarcity on vaccine hesitancy. Based on extensive scarcity literature, we initially predicted that high (vs. low) scarcity would increase demand for vaccines, operationalized as one's willingness to receive a vaccine. Contrary to this prediction, Study 1 showed that scarcity of vaccines reduced participants’ sense of priority which, in turn, also reduced their vaccination intentions. Trust in doctors moderated the effect of perceived vaccination priority on vaccination intentions such that for individuals with high trust in doctors, reduced perceived priority did not reduce their vaccination intentions as much. Study 2 replicated these effects with a more general population sample, which included at-risk individuals for COVID-19 complications. At-risk participants (vs. low-risk) had higher perceived vaccination priority, but describing vaccine doses as scarce reduced vaccination intentions similarly across both groups. Moreover, Study 2 demonstrated that compassion for others is a boundary condition of the effect of vaccine scarcity on vaccination intentions. For participants with high compassion, scarcity reduces willingness to receive a vaccine; for participants with low compassion, scarcity increases their willingness to be vaccinated. Our results suggest that health policymakers need to deemphasize the scarcity of vaccines to increase vaccine acceptance.},

   abstract = {The rapid growth in pervasive Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Deep Learning (DL) is creating a huge demand for applying DL on IoT systems. However, it is non-trivial to train highly accurate DL models in such scenarios due to the following two challenges: (1) individual IoT devices may not have sufficient training data, and (2) simply combining all sensory data across all devices may cause performance degradation due to data imbalance and varying temporal patterns across different devices. The objective of this paper is to achieve high-accurate prediction models for each device in an IoT system. We propose a federated learning approach for IoT systems driven by trend-based clustering for energy demand prediction for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station network. We first apply a time-series clustering method to identify stations with similar temporal demand patterns. Using time-series data from stations in a cluster, a single Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is trained using FedAvg algorithm for energy demand prediction for all the stations in the cluster. Experimental results on a real-world energy usage dataset from an EV charging station network show that our proposed approach is very competitive against baseline federated learning approaches. In particular, the energy demand prediction error decreases by 80%.},

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, for example, people have had to comply with successive restrictions as the world faced multiple races between controlling new waves of the virus and the development and implementation of vaccines. Here, we examine how health authorities and governments most effectively motivate the public by focusing on a specific race: between the Alpha variant and the implementation of the first generation of COVID-19 vaccinations in the winter of 2021. Following prior research on crisis communication, we focus on appeals to fear and hope using communicative aids in the form of visualizations based on epidemiological modelling. Using a population-based experiment conducted in United States (N= 3 , 022), we demonstrate that a hope-oriented visual communication aid, depicting the competing effects on the epidemic curve of (1) a more infectious variant and (2) vaccinations, motivates public action more effectively than a fear-oriented visual communication, focusing exclusively on the threat of the new variant. The importance of the implementation of such hope-oriented messages is further highlighted by cross-national representative surveys from eight countries (N= 3 , 995), which demonstrate that feelings of fear towards the Alpha variant alone were insufficient to activate strong compliance. Overall, these findings provide general insights into the importance of hope as a health communication strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.},

With complexities such as multi-component workflows, heterogeneous machine architectures, parallel file systems, and batch scheduling, care must be taken to facilitate this analysis in a high performance computing (HPC) environment. In this paper, we present Merlin, a workflow framework to enable large ML-friendly ensembles of scientific HPC simulations. By augmenting traditional HPC with distributed compute technologies, Merlin aims to lower the barrier for scientific subject matter experts to incorporate ML into their analysis. As a producer–consumer workflow model, Merlin enables multi-machine, cross-batch job, dynamically allocated yet persistent workflows capable of utilizing surge-compute resources. Key features of Merlin are a flexible HPC-centric interface, low per-task overhead, multi-tiered fault recovery, and a hierarchical sampling algorithm that allows for O(N) task execution and O(NlnN) task queuing to ensembles of millions of tasks. In addition to Merlin's design, we test the algorithm's performance in an HPC center and demonstrate the ability to enqueue 40 million simulations in 100 s, with a 30 millisecond per-task overhead that is independent of ensemble size. Finally, we describe some example applications that Merlin has enabled on leadership-class HPC resources, such as the ML-augmented optimization of nuclear fusion experiments and the calibration of infectious disease models to study the progression of and possible mitigation strategies for COVID-19.},

We introduce and critically assess an automated classification procedure that we trained to annotate more than 16,000 tweets of candidates competing in the 2018 Senate Midterms. The algorithm is able to identify the presence of political attacks (both in general, and specifically for character and policy attacks) and incivility. Due to the novel nature of the instrument, the article discusses the external and convergent validity of these measures. Results suggest that automated classifications are able to provide reliable measurements of campaign negativity. Triangulations with independent data show that our automatic classification is strongly associated with the experts’ perceptions of the candidates’ campaign. Furthermore, variations in our measures of negativity can be explained by theoretically relevant factors at the candidate and context levels (e.g., incumbency status and candidate gender); theoretically meaningful trends are also found when replicating the analysis using tweets for the 2020 Senate election, coded using the automated classifier developed for 2018. The implications of such results for the automated coding of campaign negativity in social media are discussed.},

   abstract = {Forecasting the outcome of outbreaks as early and as accurately as possible is crucial for decision-making and policy implementations. A significant challenge faced by forecasters is that not all outbreaks and epidemics turn into pandemics, making the prediction of their severity difficult. At the same time, the decisions made to enforce lockdowns and other mitigating interventions versus their socioeconomic consequences are not only hard to make, but also highly uncertain. The majority of modeling approaches to outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics take an epidemiological approach that considers biological and disease processes. In this paper, we accept the limitations of forecasting to predict the long-term trajectory of an outbreak, and instead, we propose a statistical, time series approach to modelling and predicting the short-term behavior of COVID-19. Our model assumes a multiplicative trend, aiming to capture the continuation of the two variables we predict (global confirmed cases and deaths) as well as their uncertainty. We present the timeline of producing and evaluating 10-day-ahead forecasts over a period of four months. Our simple model offers competitive forecast accuracy and estimates of uncertainty that are useful and practically relevant.},

Long COVID is characterised by evolving, heterogeneous symptoms, making it challenging to derive an unambiguous definition. Studies of electronic health records are a crucial element of the US National Institutes of Health's RECOVER Initiative, which is addressing the urgent need to understand long COVID, identify treatments, and accurately identify who has it—the latter is the aim of this study.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) electronic health record repository, we developed XGBoost machine learning models to identify potential patients with long COVID. We defined our base population (n=1 793 604) as any non-deceased adult patient (age ≥18 years) with either an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification COVID-19 diagnosis code (U07.1) from an inpatient or emergency visit, or a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test, and for whom at least 90 days have passed since COVID-19 index date. We examined demographics, health-care utilisation, diagnoses, and medications for 97 995 adults with COVID-19. We used data on these features and 597 patients from a long COVID clinic to train three machine learning models to identify potential long COVID among all patients with COVID-19, patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and patients who had COVID-19 but were not hospitalised. Feature importance was determined via Shapley values. We further validated the models on data from a fourth site.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Our models identified, with high accuracy, patients who potentially have long COVID, achieving areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0·92 (all patients), 0·90 (hospitalised), and 0·85 (non-hospitalised). Important features, as defined by Shapley values, include rate of health-care utilisation, patient age, dyspnoea, and other diagnosis and medication information available within the electronic health record.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Patients identified by our models as potentially having long COVID can be interpreted as patients warranting care at a specialty clinic for long COVID, which is an essential proxy for long COVID diagnosis as its definition continues to evolve. We also achieve the urgent goal of identifying potential long COVID in patients for clinical trials. As more data sources are identified, our models can be retrained and tuned based on the needs of individual studies.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>US National Institutes of Health and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences through the RECOVER Initiative.</p>},

   abstract = {Age-associated B cells (ABCs) have emerged as critical components of immune responses. Their inappropriate expansion and differentiation have increasingly been linked to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, aging-associated diseases, and infections. ABCs exhibit a distinctive phenotype and, in addition to classical B cell markers, often express the transcription factor T-bet and myeloid markers like CD11c; hence, these cells are also commonly known as CD11c+T-bet+ B cells. Formation of ABCs is promoted by distinctive combinations of innate and adaptive signals. In addition to producing antibodies, these cells display antigen-presenting and proinflammatory capabilities. It is becoming increasingly appreciated that the ABC compartment exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity, plasticity, and sex-specific regulation and that ABCs can differentiate into effector progeny via several routes particularly in autoimmune settings. In this review, we will discuss the initial insights that have been obtained on the molecular machinery that controls ABCs and we will highlight some of the unique aspects of this control system that may enable ABCs to fulfill their distinctive role in immune responses. Given the expanding array of autoimmune disorders and pathophysiological settings in which ABCs are being implicated, a deeper understanding of this machinery could have important and broad therapeutic implications for the successful, albeit daunting, task of targeting these cells.},

We analyzed the behavior of 40 passengers present in the same carriage as the explosion. We documented the first action of the passengers following the onset of the emergency and described evidence of pro- and anti-social behavior. Passengers’ first actions varied widely. Moreover, anti-social behavior was rare and displays of pro-sociality were more common. In a quantitative analysis, we examined spatial clustering of running behavior and patterns in passenger exit choices. We found both homogeneity and heterogeneity in the running behavior and exiting choices of passengers. We discuss the implications of these findings for the mass emergency literature and for evacuation modeling.},

Existing atmospheric methods for separating ffCO2 from large natural carbon dioxide variations are constrained by sampling limitations, so that estimates of regional changes in ffCO2 emissions, such as those occurring in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdowns, rely on indirect activity data. We present a method for quantifying regional signals of ffCO2 based on continuous atmospheric measurements of oxygen and carbon dioxide combined into the tracer "atmospheric potential oxygen"(APO). We detect and quantify ffCO2 reductions during 2020-2021 caused by the two U.K. COVID-19 lockdowns individually using APO data from Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory in the United Kingdom and a machine learning algorithm. Our APO-based assessment has near-real-time potential and provides high-frequency information that is in good agreement with the spread of ffCO2 emissions reductions from three independent lower-frequency U.K. estimates.},

Numerous microbiological molecular and serological diagnostic testing devices have been developed and authorised as benchtop systems, and only a few as rapid miniaturised, fully automated, portable digital platforms. Their successful implementation in virology relies on their performance and impact on patient management. This review describes the current progress and perspectives in developing micro- and nanotechnology-based solutions for rapidly detecting human viral respiratory infectious diseases. It provides a nonexhaustive overview of currently commercially available and under-study diagnostic testing methods and discusses the sampling and viral genetic trends as preanalytical components influencing the results.

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) affects the lives of billions of people worldwide and has destructive impacts on daily life routines, the global economy, and public health. Early diagnosis and quantification of COVID-19 infection have a vital role in improving treatment outcomes and interrupting transmission. For this purpose, advances in medical imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) scans offer great potential as an alternative to RT-PCR assay. CT scans enable a better understanding of infection morphology and tracking of lesion boundaries. Since manual analysis of CT can be extremely tedious and time-consuming, robust automated image segmentation is necessary for clinical diagnosis and decision support. This paper proposes an efficient segmentation framework based on the modified DeepLabV3+ using lower atrous rates in the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. The lower atrous rates make receptive small to capture intricate morphological details. The encoder part of the framework utilizes a pre-trained residual network based on dilated convolutions for optimum resolution of feature maps. In order to evaluate the robustness of the modified model, a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art segmentation methods was also performed. The experiments were carried out using a fivefold cross-validation technique on a publicly available database containing 100 single-slice CT scans from >40 patients with COVID-19. The modified DeepLabV3+ achieved good segmentation performance using around 43.9 M parameters. The lower atrous rates in the ASPP module improved segmentation performance. After fivefold cross-validation, the framework achieved an overall Dice similarity coefficient score of 0.881. The results demonstrate that several minor modifications to the DeepLabV3+ pipeline can provide robust solutions for improving segmentation performance and hardware implementation.},

This study aimed to develop a prognostic score for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with AKI (AKI-COV score). This was a cross-sectional multicentre prospective cohort study in the Latin America AKI COVID-19 Registry. A total of 870 COVID-19 patients with AKI defined according to the KDIGO were included between 1 May 2020 and 31 December 2020. We evaluated four categories of predictor variables that were available at the time of the diagnosis of AKI: (1) demographic data; (2) comorbidities and conditions at admission; (3) laboratory exams within 24 h; and (4) characteristics and causes of AKI. We used a machine learning approach to fit models in the training set using tenfold cross-validation and validated the accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The coefficients of the best model (Elastic Net) were used to build the predictive AKI-COV score. The AKI-COV score had an AUC-ROC of 0.823 (95% CI 0.761–0.885) in the validation cohort. The use of the AKI-COV score may assist healthcare workers in identifying hospitalized COVID-19 patients with AKI that may require more intensive monitoring and can be used for resource allocation.},

   abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) and head-mounted displays are constantly gaining popularity in various fields such as education, military, entertainment, and health. Although such technologies provide a high sense of immersion, they can also trigger symptoms of discomfort. This condition is called cybersickness (CS) and is quite popular in recent virtual reality publications. This work proposes a novel experimental analysis using symbolic machine learning to rank potential causes of CS in VR games. We estimate CS causes and rank them according to their impact using classical machine learning. Experiments are performed using two virtual reality games and 6 experimental protocols along with 37 valid samples from a total of 88 volunteers. Our results show that rotation and acceleration triggered cybersickness more frequently in a flight game in contrast to a race game. We could also observe that subjects that are less experienced with VR are more prone to feel discomfort. Former experience plays a more important role on the race game, as this game provides more liberty to the user in terms of controllers, more displacement alternatives and a more user-controlled acceleration. Furthermore, different causes that trigger discomfort arise based on short or long term VR exposures. We suggest strategies for mitigating CS for these two scenarios: short and long term exposure experiences and compare the two highlighted scenarios (race and flight).},

We performed a retrospective study in a cohort of 174 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Italy from March 3rd to May 21st 2020, to investigate the role of kidney dysfunction on COVID-19 severity and mortality. Moreover, we examined in depth the relationship between kidney function, age, and progression of COVID-19, also using different equations to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We performed logistic regressions, while a predictive analysis was made through a machine learning approach. AKI and death occurred respectively in 10.2% and 19.5%, in our population. The major risk factors for mortality in our cohort were age [adjusted HR, 6.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8–21.4] and AKI [3.36 (1.44–7.87)], while, in these relationships, GFR at baseline mitigated the role of age. The occurrence of AKI was influenced by baseline kidney function, D-dimer, procalcitonin and hypertension. Our predictive analysis for AKI and mortality reached an accuracy of ≥ 94% and ≥ 91%, respectively. Our study scales down the role of kidney function impairment on hospital admission , especially in elderly patients.

   abstract = {Rationale: Translating research evidence into clinical practice to improve care involves healthcare professionals adopting new behaviours and changing or stopping their existing behaviours. However, changing healthcare professional behaviour can be difficult, particularly when it involves changing repetitive, ingrained ways of providing care. There is an increasing focus on understanding healthcare professional behaviour in terms of non-reflective processes, such as habits and routines, in addition to the more often studied deliberative processes. Theories of habit and routine provide two complementary lenses for understanding healthcare professional behaviour, although to date, each perspective has only been applied in isolation. Objectives: To combine theories of habit and routine to generate a broader understanding of healthcare professional behaviour and how it might be changed. Methods: Sixteen experts met for a two-day multidisciplinary workshop on how to advance implementation science by developing greater understanding of non-reflective processes. Results: From a psychological perspective ‘habit’ is understood as a process that maintains ingrained behaviour through a learned link between contextual cues and behaviours that have become associated with those cues. Theories of habit are useful for understanding the individual's role in developing and maintaining specific ways of working. Theories of routine add to this perspective by describing how clinical practices are formed, adapted, reinforced and discontinued in and through interactions with colleagues, systems and organisational procedures. We suggest a selection of theory-based strategies to advance understanding of healthcare professionals' habits and routines and how to change them. Conclusion: Combining theories of habit and routines has the potential to advance implementation science by providing a fuller understanding of the range of factors, operating at multiple levels of analysis, which can impact on the behaviours of healthcare professionals, and so quality of care provision.},

We aimed to explore the psychological and cognitive factors modulating behaviour and intentions during the national lockdown in Italy. We administered an online questionnaire (N = 244) that included tests for assessing personality traits (Temperament and Character Inventory; Locus of Control of Behaviour) and moral judgment (Moral Foundations Questionnaire), alongside behavioural economics tasks addressing different facets of risk attitude (loss aversion, risk aversion and delay discounting). We then assessed the extent to which individual variations in these dimensions modulated participants’ compliance with the lockdown norms. When assessing their joint contribution via multiple regressions, lockdown adherence was mostly predicted by internal locus of control, psycho-economic dimensions suggestive of long-sighted and loss-averse attitudes, as well as personality traits related to cautionary behaviour, such as harm avoidance, and the authority moral concern. These findings show that a multi-domain assessment of the factors underlying personal intentions, and thus driving compliance with government measures, can help predict individuals’ actions during health emergencies. This evidence points to factors that should be considered when developing interventions and communication strategies to promote precautionary behaviours.},

   abstract = {This work presents a tool for forecasting the spread of the new coronavirus in Mexico City, which is based on a mathematical model with a metapopulation structure that uses Bayesian statistics and is inspired by a data-driven approach. The daily mobility of people in Mexico City is mathematically represented by an origin-destination matrix using the open mobility data from Google and the Transportation Mexican Survey. This matrix is incorporated in a compartmental model. We calibrate the model against borough-level incidence data collected between 27 February 2020 and 27 October 2020, while using Bayesian inference to estimate critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the coronavirus spread. Given that working with metapopulation models leads to rather high computational time consumption, and parameter estimation of these models may lead to high memory RAM consumption, we do a clustering analysis that is based on mobility trends to work on these clusters of borough separately instead of taken all of the boroughs together at once. This clustering analysis can be implemented in smaller or larger scales in different parts of the world. In addition, this clustering analysis is divided into the phases that the government of Mexico City has set up to restrict individual movement in the city. We also calculate the reproductive number in Mexico City using the next generation operator method and the inferred model parameters obtaining that this threshold is in the interval (1.2713, 1.3054). Our analysis of mobility trends can be helpful when making public health decisions.},

   abstract = {Background: Automated extraction of symptoms from clinical notes is a challenging task owing to the multidimensional nature of symptom description. The availability of labeled training data is extremely limited owing to the nature of the data containing protected health information. Natural language processing and machine learning to process clinical text for such a task have great potential. However, supervised machine learning requires a great amount of labeled data to train a model, which is at the origin of the main bottleneck in model development. Objective: The aim of this study is to address the lack of labeled data by proposing 2 alternatives to manual labeling for the generation of training labels for supervised machine learning with English clinical text. We aim to demonstrate that using lower-quality labels for training leads to good classification results. Methods: We addressed the lack of labels with 2 strategies. The first approach took advantage of the structured part of electronic health records and used diagnosis codes (International Classification of Disease–10th revision) to derive training labels. The second approach used weak supervision and data programming principles to derive training labels. We propose to apply the developed framework to the extraction of symptom information from outpatient visit progress notes of patients with cardiovascular diseases. Results: We used >500,000 notes for training our classification model with International Classification of Disease–10th revision codes as labels and >800,000 notes for training using labels derived from weak supervision. We show that the dependence between prevalence and recall becomes flat provided a sufficiently large training set is used (>500,000 documents). We further demonstrate that using weak labels for training rather than the electronic health record codes derived from the patient encounter leads to an overall improved recall score (10% improvement, on average). Finally, the external validation of our models shows excellent predictive performance and transferability, with an overall increase of 20% in the recall score. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the power of using a weak labeling pipeline to annotate and extract symptom mentions in clinical text, with the prospects to facilitate symptom information integration for a downstream clinical task such as clinical decision support.},

   abstract = {Background: Millions of people have limited access to specialty care. The problem is exacerbated by ineffective specialty visits due to incomplete prereferral workup, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Existing processes to guide prereferral diagnostic workup are labor-intensive (ie, building a consensus guideline between primary care doctors and specialists) and require the availability of the specialists (ie, electronic consultation). Objective: Using pediatric endocrinology as an example, we develop a recommender algorithm to anticipate patients' initial workup needs at the time of specialty referral and compare it to a reference benchmark using the most common workup orders. We also evaluate the clinical appropriateness of the algorithm recommendations. Methods: Electronic health record data were extracted from 3424 pediatric patients with new outpatient endocrinology referrals at an academic institution from 2015 to 2020. Using item co-occurrence statistics, we predicted the initial workup orders that would be entered by specialists and assessed the recommender's performance in a holdout data set based on what the specialists actually ordered. We surveyed endocrinologists to assess the clinical appropriateness of the predicted orders and to understand the initial workup process. Results: Specialists (n=12) indicated that <50% of new patient referrals arrive with complete initial workup for common referral reasons. The algorithm achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI 0.95-0.96). Compared to a reference benchmark using the most common orders, precision and recall improved from 37% to 48% (P<.001) and from 27% to 39% (P<.001) for the top 4 recommendations, respectively. The top 4 recommendations generated for common referral conditions (abnormal thyroid studies, obesity, amenorrhea) were considered clinically appropriate the majority of the time by specialists surveyed and practice guidelines reviewed. Conclusions: ?An item association–based recommender algorithm can predict appropriate specialists' workup orders with high discriminatory accuracy. This could support future clinical decision support tools to increase effectiveness and access to specialty referrals. Our study demonstrates important first steps toward a data-driven paradigm for outpatient specialty consultation with a tier of automated recommendations that proactively enable initial workup that would otherwise be delayed by awaiting an in-person visit.},

Vaccination reduced susceptibility to infection by 89.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 88.7 to 90.0%], whereas vaccine effectiveness against infectiousness given infection was 23.0% (95% CI: −11.3 to 46.7%) during days 10 to 90 after the second dose, before 1 June 2021. Total vaccine effectiveness was 91.8% (95% CI: 88.1 to 94.3%). However, vaccine effectiveness is reduced over time as a result of the combined effect of waning of immunity and emergence of the Delta variant. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted existing educational systems worldwide. Due to lockdowns in several countries, the educational institutions have been directed by governments to move towards online learning. The challenge for educational institutions and faculty members is to assess the influence of various factors that would enable adoption of online learning by students in higher education. This study investigates the influence of awareness of COVID-19 (AOC19), computer &amp; internet self-efficacy (CISE), and online communication self-efficacy (OCSE) on perceived net benefits (NB) of the students and their intention towards the online learning (INT). The study further analyzes the mediating role of students’ attitude towards online learning (ATOL). Data of 1023 students of higher education across multiple universities in India were collected and analyzed using structural equation modelling through AMOS 24 and mediation analysis through ‘PROCESS’ macro for SPSS. The findings revealed that, AOC19 positively influenced students’ NB and INT; CISE had a significant inverse relationship with NB, and partially significant positive relationship with INT; OCSE was observed to be a significant predictor of NB with positive direct relationship; ATOL had a significant full mediation among CISE and NB, and acted as significant partial mediator between CISE and INT, AOC19 and NB, AO19 and INT, OCSE and NB, and OCSE and INT. This paper would be useful for the faculty members, institutions and education technology companies in the higher education domain by enabling an understanding of the attitude, perception and intention of the students towards online learning during the COVID-19 scenario.},

In this study, we seek to provide a contextualized explanation of research phenomena by drawing upon multiple layers of context – namely the environment, TMT and organisational context. Our findings provide vital insights into how emerging market Indian SMEs’ organizational designs and TMT configurations led to differential COVID-19 crisis response strategies. We develop a typology that identifies four strategic responses and illustrate that not all emerging market SMEs are vulnerable at the time of crisis. Our findings extend knowledge on how emerging market SMEs can navigate external shocks such as those caused by COVID-19. In particular, our research has implications for policymakers and emerging market firms seeking to understand and implement effective organizational designs and policies that can weather the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future multiheaded and multistage black swan crises.},

We propose SpikeDyn, a comprehensive framework for energy-efficient SNNs with continual and unsupervised learning capabilities in dynamic environments, for both the training and inference phases. It is achieved through the following multiple diverse mechanisms: 1) reduction of neuronal operations, by replacing the inhibitory neurons with direct lateral inhibitions; 2) a memory- and energy-constrained SNN model search algorithm that employs analytical models to estimate the memory footprint and energy consumption of different candidate SNN models and selects a Pareto-optimal SNN model; and 3) a lightweight continual and unsupervised learning algorithm that employs adaptive learning rates, adaptive membrane threshold potential, weight decay, and reduction of spurious updates. Our experimental results show that, for a network with 400 excitatory neurons, our SpikeDyn reduces the energy consumption on average by 51% for training and by 37% for inference, as compared to the state-of-the-art. Due to the improved learning algorithm, SpikeDyn provides on avg. 21% accuracy improvement over the state-of-the-art, for classifying the most recently learned task, and by 8% on average for the previously learned tasks.},

   abstract = {The time-varying and non-stationary channel characteristics caused by high Doppler effects is a significant challenge for modern wireless communication systems. Aiming at the high-speed scenarios, a constellation image analysis aided channel estimation using a hybrid neural network (NN) structure, named PR-SRNN, is proposed to combat Doppler effects. Only 1 demodulation reference signal (DMRS) pilot, rather than multiple pilots as in previous reports, is needed by the proposed PR-SRNN in high-speed scenarios. The impacts from Doppler effects are analyzed and compensated by an intelligent pattern recognition neural network (PRNN) based on the contaminated constellation images. The output layer of PRNN is then merged with a super resolution NN (SRNN) which preliminarily reconstructs the channel estimation in frequency domain. Adaptive features learning against Doppler effects and synergic compensation against multipath fading are learnt jointly. It is the first time to our knowledge that a pattern recognition NN on constellation images is introduced to the physical layer, functioning as expert-like analysis system. The simulation results based on both 3GPP statistical channel models and ray tracing show that PR-SRNN exhibits robustness against diverse degrees of Doppler effects beyond the pretrained scope. Amongst different framework candidates of super resolution (SR) NNs, residual convolution SRNN with channel attention has been selected regarding its performance superiority in terms of loss and convergence speed. Furthermore, the cross validation between PR-SRNN and our previously proposed SubSRNN which takes in extra semantic information as a 2<sup>nd</sup> input proves that PR-SRNN is effective for Dopplers effects without extra side information to be reported.},

   abstract = {This study explores the multi-product inventory problem of a dual-channel warehouse to determine the optimal continuous review inventory policies. The warehouse is divided into two areas, one for fulfilling online orders and the other for storing products and fulfilling offline orders. Uncertainties are involved in the demands of the products during lead time in the two areas with their means and variances as the only known demand information. Using a distributionally robust optimization approach, the problem is formulated as a multi-product inventory model with an individual chance constraint and a multi-product inventory model with a joint chance constraint for the warehouse capacity to minimize the annual total expected cost. Two types of service levels are considered to ensure an adequate customer satisfaction. Through mathematical manipulations, the developed distributionally robust multi-product inventory models are transformed into convex programming models which can be solved efficiently, and the corresponding solution algorithms are developed. In particular, the closed-form solution of the order quantities is derived for the model with the individual chance constraint. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed models and the solution approaches in dealing with demand uncertainties and to draw specific managerial insights. Effects of important problem parameters on inventory policies and cost performance are also analyzed through numerical studies. Recommendations on the warehouse structure are given for business firms engaged in both online and offline sales. The continuous review inventory policies obtained by the proposed approach are robust and are flexible in making decisions for the operations of dual-channel warehouses and supply chains with only limited demand information. The proposed algorithms are proved to be very efficient through computational experiments.},

This thesis tackles two important problems in building the next generation of dialogue systems: enhancing the emotional intelligence of social chatbots and learning semantic structures from dialogue corpus. On the one hand, taking into account emotional quotient in dialogue system design help machine to mimic human behavior and further improve the long-term user engagement. On the other hand, extracting structural information from dialogue data is critical for us to analyze user behavior and system performance. The technology could be applied to various areas in computational linguistics, such as dialogue management, discourse analysis, and dialogue summarization.This thesis consists of two parts. In the first part, we aim to present our efforts at studying emotional intelligence in dialogues systems. We break down the problem into three subjects: 1) the modeling and incorporation of human values, i.c., people tend to have common attitudes towards some statements or scenarios; 2) the inference of social relations between interlocutors from dialogues. Chatbots with such inferring capability can understand human behavior better and act appropriately; and 3) the modeling and tracking of speakers' mental states. This is beyond understanding what users say to perceive what users imply, requiring agents to mentally simulate the evolution status of the environment.In the second part of this thesis, we investigate how we can extract structural information from dialogue corpus. In particular, we pioneered two research directions: 1) we reconstruct the original dialogues with variational recurrent neural networks and structured attention, then we extract the structure by computing the transitions between latent states; and 2) we detect and track the status of potential slot token groups to approximate a representation of task-oriented dialogue structures. We explored the problem from both theoretical and practical perspectives.},

Thus, there is an urgent need to study the dynamics of epidemiological models to gain a better understanding of how such diseases spread. While epidemiological models can be computationally expensive, recent advances in machine learning techniques have given rise to neural networks with the ability to learn and predict complex dynamics at reduced computational costs. Here we introduce two digital twins of a SEIRS model applied to an idealised town. The SEIRS model has been modified to take account of spatial variation and, where possible, the model parameters are based on official virus spreading data from the UK. We compare predictions from one digital twin based on a data-corrected Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network with predictions from another digital twin based on a predictive Generative Adversarial Network. The predictions given by these two frameworks are accurate when compared to the original SEIRS model data. Additionally, these frameworks are data-agnostic and could be applied to towns, idealised or real, in the UK or in other countries. Also, more compartments could be included in the SEIRS model, in order to study more realistic epidemiological behaviour.},

   abstract = {Airborne dispersion of the novel SARS-CoV-2 through the droplets produced during expiratory activities is one of the main transmission mechanisms of this virus from one person to another. Understanding how these droplets spread when infected humans with COVID-19 or other airborne infectious diseases breathe, cough or sneeze is essential for improving prevention strategies in academic facilities. This work aims to assess the transport and fate of droplets in indoor environments using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This study employs unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations with the Euler-Lagrange approach to visualize the location of thousands of droplets released in a respiratory event and their size evolution. Furthermore, we assess the dispersion of coughing, sneezing, and breathing saliva droplets from an infected source in a classroom with air conditioning and multiple occupants. The results indicate that the suggested social distancing protocol is not enough to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 since small saliva droplets ( ≤ 12 μm) can travel in the streamwise direction up to 4 m when an infected person coughs and more than 7 m when sneezes. These droplets can reach those distances even when there is no airflow from the wind or ventilation systems. The number of airborne droplets in locations close to the respiratory system of a healthy person increases when the relative humidity of the indoor environment is low. This work sets an accurate, rapid, and validated numerical framework reproducible for various indoor environments integrating qualitative and quantitative data analysis of the droplet size evolution of respiratory events for a safer design of physical distancing standards and air cleaning technologies.},

   abstract = {Covid-19, what a strange, unpredictable mutated virus. It has baffled many scientists, as no firm rule has yet been reached to predict the effect that the virus can inflict on people if they are infected with it. Recently, many researches have been introduced for diagnosing Covid-19; however, none of them pay attention to predict the effect of the virus on the person's body if the infection occurs but before the infection really takes place. Predicting the extent to which people will be affected if they are infected with the virus allows for some drastic precautions to be taken for those who will suffer from serious complications, while allowing some freedom for those who expect not to be affected badly. This paper introduces Covid-19 Prudential Expectation Strategy (CPES) as a new strategy for predicting the behavior of the person's body if he has been infected with Covid-19. The CPES composes of three phases called Outlier Rejection Phase (ORP), Feature Selection Phase (FSP), and Classification Phase (CP). For enhancing the classification accuracy in CP, CPES employs two proposed techniques for outlier rejection in ORP and feature selection in FSP, which are called Hybrid Outlier Rejection (HOR) method and Improved Binary Genetic Algorithm (IBGA) method respectively. In ORP, HOR rejects outliers in the training data using a hybrid method that combines standard division and Binary Gray Wolf Optimization (BGWO) method. On the other hand, in FSP, IBGA as a hybrid method selects the most useful features for the prediction process. IBGA includes Fisher Score (FScore) as a filter method to quickly select the features and BGA as a wrapper method to accurately select the features based on the average accuracy value from several classification models as a fitness function to guarantee the efficiency of the selected subset of features with any classifier. In CP, CPES has the ability to classify people based on their bodies’ reaction to Covid-19 infection, which is built upon a proposed Statistical Naïve Bayes (SNB) classifier after performing the previous two phases. CPES has been compared against recent related strategies in terms of accuracy, error, recall, precision, and run-time using Covid-19 dataset [1]. This dataset contains routine blood tests collected from people before and after their infection with covid-19 through a Web-based form created by us. CPES outperforms the competing methods in experimental results because it provides the best results with values of 0.87, 0.13, 0.84, and 0.79 for accuracy, error, precision, and recall.},

   abstract = {Unfortunately, Covid-19 has infected millions of people very quickly, and it continues to infect people and spreads rapidly. Although there are some common symptoms of Covid-19, its effect varies from one individual to another. Estimating the severity of the infection has become a critical need as it can guide the decision makers to take an accurate and timely response. It will be valuable to provide early warning before infection takes place about susceptibility to the disease, especially since the lack of symptoms is a feature of the Covid-19 pandemic. Asymptomatic patients are considered as “silent diffusers” of the virus; hence, detecting people who will be asymptomatic before actual infection takes place will certainly safe the society from the uncontrolled and unseen spread of the virus. People can be classified based on their vulnerability to Covid-19 even before they are infected. Accordingly, precautionary measures can be taken individually based on the persons' Covid-19 susceptibility. This paper introduces a Covid-19's Integrated Herd Immunity (CIHI) strategy. The aim of CIHI is to keep the society safe with the minimal losses even with the existence of Covid-19. This can be accomplished by two basic factors; the first is an accurate prediction of the cases who will be asymptomatic if they were infected by the virus, while the second is to take suitable precautions for those who are predicted to be badly affected by the virus even before the actual infection takes place. CIHI is realized through a new classification strategy called Distance Based Classification Strategy (DBCS) which classifies people based on their vulnerability to Covid-19 infection. The proposed DBCS classifies individuals into six different types, then suitable precautionary measures can be taken for every type. DBCS can also identify future symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. In fact, DBCS consists of three sequential phases, which are; (i) Outlier Rejection Phase (ORP) using Hybrid Outlier Rejection (HOR) method, (ii) Feature Selection Phase (FSP) using Hybrid Feature Selection (HFS) method, and (iii) Classification Phase (CP) using Accumulative K-Nearest Neighbors (AKNN). DBCS has been compared with recent Covid-19 diagnosing techniques based on “NileDS” dataset. Experimental results have proven the efficiency and applicability of the proposed strategy as it provides the best classification accuracy.},

   abstract = {It is critical to establish a reliable method for detecting people infected with COVID-19 since the pandemic has numerous harmful consequences worldwide. If the patient is infected with COVID-19, a chest X-ray can be used to determine this. In this work, an X-ray showing a COVID-19 infection is classified by the capsule neural network model we trained to recognise. 6310 chest X-ray pictures were used to train the models, separated into three categories: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19. This work is considered an improved deep learning model for the classification of COVID-19 disease through X-ray images. Viewpoint invariance, fewer parameters, and better generalisation are some of the advantages of CapsNet compared with the classic convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The proposed model has achieved an accuracy greater than 95% during the model’s training, which is better than the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, to aid in detecting COVID-19 in a chest X-ray, the model could provide extra information.},

   abstract = {Supply chain resilience (SCRES) is an emerging research area, which plays a crucial role in protecting supply chains (SCs) against small- to large-scale disruptions. Over the past few years, many researchers have focused on developing SCRES strategies that have significantly contributed to mitigating SC disruptions. While the number of papers on this subject has been gradually increasing, the absence of a systematic literature review means that it is unclear which SCRES strategies for mitigating SC disruptions have already been studied and which issues still need to be investigated. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive overview of SC resilience initiatives and strategies. For the review and synthesis conducted in this paper, 151 relevant articles were identified through a systematic search and selection of papers published between 2010 and 2021. First, the main themes of the SCRES strategies were categorized. The development of SCRES strategies for preparedness, response, and recovery, aimed at mitigating SC disruptions, was reviewed. Second, a detailed analysis of research developments in SCRES strategies was conducted, along with an investigation into the methodological, theoretical, and contextual justifications for tackling SC disruptions. Third, literature on SCRES strategies was synthesized for mapping and identifying potential research gaps. The analysis revealed that there is a scarcity of simulation model-based and theoretically grounded studies to mitigate large-scale SC disruptions. Moreover, it was also found that most studies have identified SCRES strategies for low-demand luxury products, while high-demand essential products and services have largely been ignored. Finally, based on the analysis, this article identifies research questions and future research directions for the field of SCRES research. These can guide academics and practitioners in designing and leading effective research in the field.},

   abstract = {The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is considered the current gold standard for the detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), although it suffers from some shortcomings, namely comparatively longer turnaround time, higher false-negative rates around 20–25%, and higher cost equipment. Therefore, finding an efficient, robust, accurate, and widely available, and accessible alternative to RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis is a matter of utmost importance. This study proposes a complete blood count (CBC) biomarkers-based COVID-19 detection system using a stacking machine learning (SML) model, which could be a fast and less expensive alternative. This study used seven different publicly available datasets, where the largest one consisting of fifteen CBC biomarkers collected from 1624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive) admitted at San Raphael Hospital, Italy from February to May 2020 was used to train and validate the proposed model. White blood cell count, monocytes (%), lymphocyte (%), and age parameters collected from the patients during hospital admission were found to be important biomarkers for COVID-19 disease prediction using five different feature selection techniques. Our stacking model produced the best performance with weighted precision, sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and F1-score of 91.44%, 91.44%, 91.44%, 91.45%, and 91.45%, respectively. The stacking machine learning model improved the performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. Finally, a nomogram-based scoring system (QCovSML) was constructed using this stacking approach to predict the COVID-19 patients. The cut-off value of the QCovSML system for classifying COVID-19 and Non-COVID patients was 4.8. Six datasets from three different countries were used to externally validate the proposed model to evaluate its generalizability and robustness. The nomogram demonstrated good calibration and discrimination with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.961 for the internal cohort and average AUC of 0.967 for all external validation cohort, respectively. The external validation shows an average weighted precision, sensitivity, F1-score, specificity, and overall accuracy of 92.02%, 95.59%, 93.73%, 90.54%, and 93.34%, respectively.},

   abstract = {<p>Proteins are direct products of the genome and metabolites are functional products of interactions between the host and other factors such as environment, disease state, clinical information, etc. Omics data, including proteins and metabolites, are useful in characterizing biological processes underlying COVID-19 along with patient data and clinical information, yet few methods are available to effectively analyze such diverse and unstructured data. Using an integrated approach that combines proteomics and metabolomics data, we investigated the changes in metabolites and proteins in relation to patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and health outcome) and clinical information (e.g., metabolic panel and complete blood count test results). We found significant enrichment of biological indicators of lung, liver, and gastrointestinal dysfunction associated with disease severity using publicly available metabolite and protein profiles. Our analyses specifically identified enriched proteins that play a critical role in responses to injury or infection within these anatomical sites, but may contribute to excessive systemic inflammation within the context of COVID-19. Furthermore, we have used this information in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to predict the health status of patients presenting symptoms of COVID-19. This work provides a roadmap for understanding the biochemical pathways and molecular mechanisms that drive disease severity, progression, and treatment of COVID-19.</p>},

   abstract = {Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition that is often considered to have broad and subjective diagnostic criteria and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Early and accurate prediction of ARDS and related conditions such as hypoxemia and sepsis could allow timely administration of therapies, leading to improved patient outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study is to perform an exploration of how multilabel classification in the clinical setting can take advantage of the underlying dependencies between ARDS and related conditions to improve early prediction of ARDS in patients. Methods: The electronic health record data set included 40,703 patient encounters from 7 hospitals from April 20, 2018, to March 17, 2021. A recurrent neural network (RNN) was trained using data from 5 hospitals, and external validation was conducted on data from 2 hospitals. In addition to ARDS, 12 target labels for related conditions such as sepsis, hypoxemia, and COVID-19 were used to train the model to classify a total of 13 outputs. As a comparator, XGBoost models were developed for each of the 13 target labels. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Heat maps to visualize attention scores were generated to provide interpretability to the neural networks. Finally, cluster analysis was performed to identify potential phenotypic subgroups of patients with ARDS. Results: The single RNN model trained to classify 13 outputs outperformed the individual XGBoost models for ARDS prediction, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.842 on the external test sets. Models trained on an increasing number of tasks resulted in improved performance. Earlier prediction of ARDS nearly doubled the rate of in-hospital survival. Cluster analysis revealed distinct ARDS subgroups, some of which had similar mortality rates but different clinical presentations. Conclusions: The RNN model presented in this paper can be used as an early warning system to stratify patients who are at risk of developing one of the multiple risk outcomes, hence providing practitioners with the means to take early action.},

The complex network analysis of the bioacoustics signals - vesicular (VE) and bronchial (BR) breath sound - of 48 healthy persons are carried out for understanding the airflow dynamics during respiration. The VE and BR are classified by the machine learning techniques extracting the graph features – the number of edges (E), graph density (D), transitivity (T), degree centrality (Dcg) and eigenvector centrality (Ecg). The higher value of E, D, and T in BR indicates the temporally correlated airflow through the wider tracheobronchial tract resulting in sustained high-intense low-frequencies. The frequency spread and high-frequencies in VE, arising due to the less correlated airflow through the narrow segmental bronchi and lobar, appears as a lower value for E, D, and T. The lower values of Dcg and Ecg justify the inferences from the spectral and other graph parameters. The study proposes a methodology in remote auscultation that can be employed in the current scenario of COVID-19.},

Study Type/Design: Prospective interventional study. Methods: Subjects with glottic insufficiency secondary to unilateral vocal fold paresis, paralysis, or atrophy, and scheduled for injection laryngoplasty completed an instrumental assessment of voluntary cough airflow using a pneumotachometer and a protocolized voluntary cough sound recording. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the differences between pre- and post-injection laryngoplasty in airflow and acoustic measures. A Spearman rank-order correlation was used to evaluate the association between airflow and acoustic cough measures. Results: Twenty-five patients (13F:12M, mean age 68.8) completed voluntary cough airflow measurements and 22 completed cough sound recordings. Following injection laryngoplasty, patients had a statistically significant decreased peak expiratory flow rise time (PEFRT) (mean change: −0.03 s, SD: 0.06, p = 0.04) and increased cough volume acceleration (mean change: 13.1 L/s2, SD: 33.9, p = 0.03), suggesting improved cough effectiveness. Correlation of cough acoustic measures with airflow measures showed a weak relationship between PEFRT and acoustic energy (coefficient: −0.31, p = 0.04) and peak power density (coefficient: −0.35, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Our study thus indicates that injection laryngoplasty may help avert aspiration in patients with glottic insufficiency by improving cough effectiveness and that improved cough airflow measures may be tracked with cough sounds.

   abstract = {Background: Predicting outcomes of patients with COVID-19 at an early stage is crucial for optimised clinical care and resource management, especially during a pandemic. Although multiple machine learning models have been proposed to address this issue, because of their requirements for extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, they have not been validated or implemented outside of their original study site. Therefore, we aimed to develop accurate and transferrable predictive models of outcomes on hospital admission for patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this study, we developed recurrent neural network-based models (CovRNN) to predict the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by use of available electronic health record data on admission to hospital, without the need for specific feature selection or missing data imputation. CovRNN was designed to predict three outcomes: in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and prolonged hospital stay (>7 days). For in-hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation, CovRNN produced time-to-event risk scores (survival prediction; evaluated by the concordance index) and all-time risk scores (binary prediction; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] was the main metric); we only trained a binary classification model for prolonged hospital stay. For binary classification tasks, we compared CovRNN against traditional machine learning algorithms: logistic regression and light gradient boost machine. Our models were trained and validated on the heterogeneous, deidentified data of 247 960 patients with COVID-19 from 87 US health-care systems derived from the Cerner Real-World COVID-19 Q3 Dataset up to September 2020. We held out the data of 4175 patients from two hospitals for external validation. The remaining 243 785 patients from the 85 health systems were grouped into training (n=170 626), validation (n=24 378), and multi-hospital test (n=48 781) sets. Model performance was evaluated in the multi-hospital test set. The transferability of CovRNN was externally validated by use of deidentified data from 36 140 patients derived from the US-based Optum deidentified COVID-19 electronic health record dataset (version 1015; from January, 2007, to Oct 15, 2020). Exact dates of data extraction were masked by the databases to ensure patient data safety. Findings: CovRNN binary models achieved AUROCs of 93·0% (95% CI 92·6–93·4) for the prediction of in-hospital mortality, 92·9% (92·6–93·2) for the prediction of mechanical ventilation, and 86·5% (86·2–86·9) for the prediction of a prolonged hospital stay, outperforming light gradient boost machine and logistic regression algorithms. External validation confirmed AUROCs in similar ranges (91·3–97·0% for in-hospital mortality prediction, 91·5–96·0% for the prediction of mechanical ventilation, and 81·0–88·3% for the prediction of prolonged hospital stay). For survival prediction, CovRNN achieved a concordance index of 86·0% (95% CI 85·1–86·9) for in-hospital mortality and 92·6% (92·2–93·0) for mechanical ventilation. Interpretation: Trained on a large, heterogeneous, real-world dataset, our CovRNN models showed high prediction accuracy and transferability through consistently good performances on multiple external datasets. Our results show the feasibility of a COVID-19 predictive model that delivers high accuracy without the need for complex feature engineering.

Overall, results highlight that even as advances in technology make possible a variety of ways to monitor workers, organizations must continue to consider the psychological component of work.},

Effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, but a proportion of people either are hesitant or refuse to be vaccinated, facilitated by a global misinformation campaign. If ‘herd immunity’ cannot be achieved, there is potential not only for ongoing surges in infection, but also for development of new strains of the virus that could evade vaccines and precipitate further health and economic crises. We review the economics of vaccination and of vaccine hesitancy and refusal, and their potential effects on the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {Background: Health kiosks are publicly accessible computing devices that provide access to services, including health information provision, clinical measurement collection, patient self–check-in, telemonitoring, and teleconsultation. Although the increase in internet access and ownership of smart personal devices could make kiosks redundant, recent reports have predicted that the market will continue to grow. Objective: We seek to clarify the current and future roles of health kiosks by investigating the settings, roles, and clinical domains in which kiosks are used; whether usability evaluations of health kiosks are being reported, and if so, what methods are being used; and what the barriers and facilitators are for the deployment of kiosks. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using a bibliographic search of Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for studies and other publications between January 2009 and June 2020. Eligible papers described the implementation as primary studies, systematic reviews, or news and feature articles. Additional reports were obtained by manual searching and querying the key informants. For each article, we abstracted settings, purposes, health domains, whether the kiosk was opportunistic or integrated with a clinical pathway, and whether the kiosk included usability testing. We then summarized the data in frequency tables. Results: A total of 141 articles were included, of which 134 (95%) were primary studies, and 7 (5%) were reviews. Approximately 47% (63/134) of the primary studies described kiosks in secondary care settings. Other settings included community (32/134, 23.9%), primary care (24/134, 17.9%), and pharmacies (8/134, 6%). The most common roles of the health kiosks were providing health information (47/134, 35.1%), taking clinical measurements (28/134, 20.9%), screening (17/134, 12.7%), telehealth (11/134, 8.2%), and patient registration (8/134, 6.0%). The 5 most frequent health domains were multiple conditions (33/134, 24.6%), HIV (10/134, 7.5%), hypertension (10/134, 7.5%), pediatric injuries (7/134, 5.2%), health and well-being (6/134, 4.5%), and drug monitoring (6/134, 4.5%). Kiosks were integrated into the clinical pathway in 70.1% (94/134) of studies, opportunistic kiosks accounted for 23.9% (32/134) of studies, and in 6% (8/134) of studies, kiosks were used in both. Usability evaluations of kiosks were reported in 20.1% (27/134) of papers. Barriers (e.g., use of expensive proprietary software) and enablers (e.g., handling of on-demand consultations) of deploying health kiosks were identified. Conclusions: Health kiosks still play a vital role in the health care system, including collecting clinical measurements and providing access to web-based health services and information to those with little or no digital literacy skills and others without personal internet access. We identified research gaps, such as training needs for teleconsultations and scant reporting on usability evaluation methods.},

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due to the growing literature on COVID-19, it is hard to get precise, up-to-date information about the virus. Practitioners, front-line workers, and researchers require expert-specific methods to stay current on scientific knowledge and research findings. However, there are a lot of research papers being written on the subject, which makes it hard to keep up with the most recent research. This problem motivates us to propose the design of the COVID-19 Search Engine (CO-SE), which is an algorithmic system that finds relevant documents for each query (asked by a user) and answers complex questions by searching a large corpus of publications. The CO-SE has a retriever component trained on the TF-IDF vectorizer that retrieves the relevant documents from the system. It also consists of a reader component that consists of a Transformer-based model, which is used to read the paragraphs and find the answers related to the query from the retrieved documents. The proposed model has outperformed previous models, obtaining an exact match ratio score of 71.45% and a semantic answer similarity score of 78.55%. It also outperforms other benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed approach.},

   abstract = {Background: Due to the growing amount of COVID-19 research literature, medical experts, clinical scientists, and researchers frequently struggle to stay up to date on the most recent findings. There is a pressing need to assist researchers and practitioners in mining and responding to COVID-19-related questions on time. Methods: This paper introduces CoQUAD, a question-answering system that can extract answers related to COVID-19 questions in an efficient manner. There are two datasets provided in this work: a reference-standard dataset built using the CORD-19 and LitCOVID initiatives, and a gold-standard dataset prepared by the experts from a public health domain. The CoQUAD has a Retriever component trained on the BM25 algorithm that searches the reference-standard dataset for relevant documents based on a question related to COVID-19. CoQUAD also has a Reader component that consists of a Transformer-based model, namely MPNet, which is used to read the paragraphs and find the answers related to a question from the retrieved documents. In comparison to previous works, the proposed CoQUAD system can answer questions related to early, mid, and post-COVID-19 topics. Results: Extensive experiments on CoQUAD Retriever and Reader modules show that CoQUAD can provide effective and relevant answers to any COVID-19-related questions posed in natural language, with a higher level of accuracy. When compared to state-of-the-art baselines, CoQUAD outperforms the previous models, achieving an exact match ratio score of 77.50% and an F1 score of 77.10%. Conclusion: CoQUAD is a question-answering system that mines COVID-19 literature using natural language processing techniques to help the research community find the most recent findings and answer any related questions.

   abstract = {Diagnostic tests that detect antibodies (AB) against SARS-CoV-2 for evaluation of seroprevalence and guidance of health care measures are important tools for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Current tests have certain limitations with regard to turnaround time, costs and availability, particularly in point-of-care (POC) settings. We established a hemagglutination-based AB test that is based on bi-specific proteins which contain a dromedary-derived antibody (nanobody) binding red blood cells (RBD) and a SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen, such as the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein (Spike-RBD). While the nanobody mediates swift binding to RBC, the antigen moiety directs instantaneous, visually apparent hemagglutination in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific AB generated in COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. Method comparison studies with assays cleared by emergency use authorization demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity. To further increase objectivity of test interpretation, we developed an image analysis tool based on digital image acquisition (via a cell phone) and a machine learning algorithm based on defined sample-training and -validation datasets. Preliminary data, including a small clinical study, provides proof of principle for test performance in a POC setting. Together, the data support the interpretation that this AB test format, which we refer to as ‘NanoSpot.ai’, is suitable for POC testing, can be manufactured at very low costs and, based on its generic mode of action, can likely be adapted to a variety of other pathogens.},

   abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Beta variant of concern (VOC) resists neutralization by major classes of antibodies from COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals. In this study, serum of Beta-infected patients revealed reduced cross-neutralization of wild-type virus. From these patients, we isolated Beta-specific and cross-reactive receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies. The Beta-specificity results from recruitment of VOC-specific clonotypes and accommodation of mutations present in Beta and Omicron into a major antibody class that is normally sensitive to these mutations. The Beta-elicited cross-reactive antibodies share genetic and structural features with wild type-elicited antibodies, including a public VH1-58 clonotype that targets the RBD ridge. These findings advance our understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 shaped by antigenic drift, with implications for design of next-generation vaccines and therapeutics.

   abstract = {In this work, we analyse the collective dynamics of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with distance dependent memristor and mean field coupling, realised by power law exponent. The memristor characterises the electromagnetic field induced by the magnetic flux. The mean field represents the global effect in the neurons which are usually influenced by enormous number of neighbours. The uniform global mean field drives the memristive neural network from Amplitude Death to synchronised bursting state. Desynchronised, Mixed Oscillatory, imperfect and complete synchronised states are attained by the network due to the interplay between memristor and uniform mean field coupling. The synchronisation scenario has been analysed in distance dependent memristive and mean field network, by varying the values of power law exponent. The distance dependent mean field coupling induces chimera and multichimera states in the system. The strength of incoherence and discontinuity measure are calculated to distinguish incoherent, chimera, multichimera and coherent states. Coherent states are unattainable for high values of power law exponent. The existence of chimera states in system with long range interactions are verified by parameter space. This work may give better understanding about the different aspects of synchronisation involved in neural networks with distance dependent coupling and proves that the non local synaptic coupling is not a prerequisite to realise chimera states.},

   abstract = {Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a crisis worldwide. Amounts of efforts have been made to prevent and control COVID-19’s transmission, from early screenings to vaccinations and treatments. Recently, due to the spring up of many automatic disease recognition applications based on machine listening techniques, it would be fast and cheap to detect COVID-19 from recordings of cough, a key symptom of COVID-19. To date, knowledge on the acoustic characteristics of COVID-19 cough sounds is limited, but would be essential for structuring effective and robust machine learning models. The present study aims to explore acoustic features for distinguishing COVID-19 positive individuals from COVID-19 negative ones based on their cough sounds.Methods With the theory of computational paralinguistics, we analyse the acoustic correlates of COVID-19 cough sounds based on the COMPARE feature set, i. e., a standardised set of 6,373 acoustic higher-level features. Furthermore, we train automatic COVID-19 detection models with machine learning methods and explore the latent features by evaluating the contribution of all features to the COVID-19 status predictions.Results The experimental results demonstrate that a set of acoustic parameters of cough sounds, e. g., statistical functionals of the root mean square energy and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, are relevant for the differentiation between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative cough samples. Our automatic COVID-19 detection model performs significantly above chance level, i. e., at an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 0.632, on a data set consisting of 1,411 cough samples (COVID-19 positive/negative: 210/1,201).Conclusions Based on the acoustic correlates analysis on the COMPARE feature set and the feature analysis in the effective COVID-19 detection model, we find that the machine learning method to a certain extent relies on acoustic features showing higher effects in conventional group difference testing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported by the European Union&#039;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Initial Training Network European Training Network project TAPAS (grant number 766287), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft&#039;s Reinhart Koselleck project AUDI0NOMOUS (grant number 442218748), and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany, under the project LeibnizKILabor (grant No. 01DD20003).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The authors want to express their gratitude to the holders of the COUGHVID crowdsourcing dataset for providing collected data for research purposes.

   abstract = {The paper proposes a novel approach to bring out the potential of complex networks based on graph theory to unwrap the hidden characteristics of cough signals, croup (BC), and pertussis (PS). The spectral and complex network analyses of 48 cough sounds are utilized for understanding the airflow through the infected respiratory tract. Among the different phases of the cough sound time-domain signals of BC and PS – expulsive (X), intermediate (I), and voiced (V) - the phase ‘I’ is noisy in BC due to improper glottal functioning. The spectral analyses reveal high-frequency components in both cough signals with an additional high-intense low-frequency spread in BC. The complex network features created by the correlation mapping approach, like number of edges (E), graph density (G), transitivity (Tr), degree centrality (D), average path length (L), and number of components (Nc) distinguishes BC and PS. The higher values of E, G, and Tr for BC indicate its musical nature through the strong correlation between the signal segments and the presence of high-intense low-frequency components in BC, unlike that in PS. The values of D, L, and Nc discriminate BC and PS in terms of the strength of the correlation between the nodes within them. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic support vector machine (QSVM) classifies BC and PS, with greater accuracy of 94.11% for LDA. The proposed work opens up the potentiality of employing complex networks for cough sound analysis, which is vital in the current scenario of COVID-19.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 presents a complex disease that needs to be addressed using systems medicine approaches that include genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). Previous studies have used a single model extraction method (MEM) and/or a single transcriptomic dataset to reconstruct context-specific models, which proved to be insufficient for the broader biological contexts. We have applied four MEMs in combination with five COVID-19 datasets. Models produced by GIMME were separated by infection, while tINIT preserved the biological variability in the data and enabled the best prediction of the enrichment of metabolic subsystems. Vitamin D3 metabolism was predicted to be down-regulated in one dataset by GIMME, and in all by tINIT. Models generated by tINIT and GIMME predicted downregulation of retinol metabolism in different datasets, while downregulated cholesterol metabolism was predicted only by tINIT-generated models. Predictions are in line with the observations in COVID-19 patients. Our data indicated that GIMME and tINIT models provided the most biologically relevant results and should have a larger emphasis in further analyses. Particularly tINIT models identified the metabolic pathways that are a part of the host response and are potential antiviral targets. The code and the results of the analyses are available to download from https://github.com/CompBioLj/COVID_GEMs_and_MEMs.},

   abstract = {With the current challenges in population growth and scarceness of food, new technologies are emerging. Remote sensing in general and satellite imagery more specifically are part of these technologies which can help provide accurate monitoring and classification of cultivars. Part of the increase in the use of these technologies has to do with the ongoing increment on the spatial–temporal resolution together with the free availability of some of these services. Typically time series are used as a pre-processing technique and combined with supervised learning techniques in order to build models for crop type identification in remote images. However, these models suffer from the lack of labelled data sets needed to train them. Unsupervised classification can overcome this limitation but has been less frequently used in this research field. This paper proposes to test and analyse the performance of several unsupervised clustering algorithms towards crop type identification on remote images. In this manner combinations of clustering algorithms and distance measures, a key element in the behaviour of these algorithms, are studied using an experimental design with more than twenty datasets built from the combinations of five crops and more than 45000 parcels. Results highlight better clustering methods and distance measures to create accurate and novel crop mapping models for remote sensing images.},

   abstract = {Machine translation (MT) is now widely and freely available, and has the potential to greatly improve cross-lingual communication. In order to use MT reliably and safely, end users must be able to assess the quality of system outputs and determine how much they can rely on them to guide their decisions and actions. However, it can be difficult for users to detect and recover from mistranslations due to limited language skills. In this work we collected 19 MT-mediated role-play conversations in housing and employment scenarios, and conducted in-depth interviews to understand how users identify and recover from translation errors. Participants communicated using four language pairs: English, and one of Spanish, Farsi, Igbo, or Tagalog. We conducted qualitative analysis to understand user challenges in light of limited system transparency, strategies for recovery, and the kinds of translation errors that proved more or less difficult for users to overcome. We found that users broadly lacked relevant and helpful information to guide their assessments of translation quality. Instances where a user erroneously thought they had understood a translation correctly were rare but held the potential for serious consequences in the real world. Finally, inaccurate and disfluent translations had social consequences for participants, because it was difficult to discern when a disfluent message was reflective of the other person’s intentions, or an artifact of imperfect MT. We draw on theories of grounding and repair in communication to contextualize these findings, and propose design implications for explainable AI (XAI) researchers, MT researchers, as well as collaboration among them to support transparency and explainability in MT.

   abstract = {Introduction The complex dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made obtaining reliable long-term forecasts of the disease progression difficult. Simple mechanistic models with deterministic parameters are useful for short-term predictions but have ultimately been unsuccessful in extrapolating the trajectory of the pandemic because of unmodelled dynamics and the unrealistic level of certainty that is assumed in the predictions. Methods and analysis We propose a 22-compartment epidemiological model that includes compartments not previously considered concurrently, to account for the effects of vaccination, asymptomatic individuals, inadequate access to hospital care, post-acute COVID-19 and recovery with long-term health complications. Additionally, new connections between compartments introduce new dynamics to the system and provide a framework to study the sensitivity of model outputs to several concurrent effects, including temporary immunity, vaccination rate and vaccine effectiveness. Subject to data availability for a given region, we discuss a means by which population demographics (age, comorbidity, socioeconomic status, sex and geographical location) and clinically relevant information (different variants, different vaccines) can be incorporated within the 22-compartment framework. Considering a probabilistic interpretation of the parameters allows the model's predictions to reflect the current state of uncertainty about the model parameters and model states. We propose the use of a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm for parameter calibration and model selection. This methodology considers a combination of prescribed parameter prior distributions for parameters that are known to be essential to the modelled dynamics and automatic relevance determination priors for parameters whose relevance is questionable. This is useful as it helps prevent overfitting the available epidemiological data when calibrating the parameters of the proposed model. Population-level administrative health data will serve as partial observations of the model states.

However, these outdoor activities have been discontinued and prohibited due to the travel restrictions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized virtual Google Earth Learning Activities (GELA) to provide alternative virtual experiences for the students learning environmental concepts. Moreover, this study aimed to assess the effects of GELA on students' environmental awareness and environmental attitudes. A quasi-experimental research design following a mixed-method approach was used in the study. The participants were 156 senior high school students from a private school in Manila, Philippines. Survey questionnaires were distributed online via Google forms, and the Focus Group Discussion was conducted synchronously thru Zoom video conferencing. Results revealed that students' environmental awareness moderately increased after performing the GELA (g=0.87, p&lt;0.05), while there was a significantly high increase in students' environmental attitudes (g=0.66, p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, it was also revealed that ecological awareness could predict ecological attitude, implying that there is also a good attitude towards the environment to those with great environmental awareness. Three themes were generated in the thematic analysis: Scientific Learning, Independent Learning, and Student Engagement. Overall, this study found that GELA is an effective teaching tool enhancing students' environmental awareness and attitude.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Focusing on the challenge of minimizing the level of stress to which cyclists are exposed to when cycling, the objective of this study is to assess the applicability of an important index to classify routes in terms of stress for cycling, the Level of Traffic Stress (LTS), to a medium-sized city in a developing country. Method: For this purpose, physiological measures of stress of 15 cyclists, recorded while cycling on roads with different characteristics in the city of São Carlos, Brazil, were used to create a scale that was then compared to the LTS. In addition, applying the Random Forests technique using variables identified with video recordings collected during the trips allowed us to identify relevant causes of stress, and thus incorporate them into the LTS classification to improve their suitability to represent real-life situations. Results: The results showed no correlation between the LTS classification and the actual stress experienced by cyclists, but also showed that the LTS classification can be improved, bringing it closer to the actual stress experienced by cyclists, by simply adding two factors, which can be easily obtained: uphill grades and the presence of roundabouts. Conclusions: We showed that the use of the two indicators we proposed, associated with the LTS method, are particularly interesting to classify routes according to cyclists’ stress, especially in cases when some variables (e.g., traffic volume) used in other indexes are difficult to obtain. A limitation of this study is that the data refer to a city with specific characteristics. Therefore, future works should address the validity of the method in places with different social, infrastructure and climatic characteristics and in a sample with different characteristics of gender, age and aptitude to cycle.},

   abstract = {Remote monitoring platforms based on advanced health sensors have the potential to become important tools during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting the reduction in risks for affected populations such as the elderly. Current commercially available wearable devices still have limitations to deal with heart rate variability (HRV), an important health indicator of human aging. This study analyzes the role of a remote monitoring system designed to support health services to older people during the complete course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, since its beginning in Brazil in March 2020 until November 2021, based on HRV. Using different levels of analysis and data, we validated HRV parameters by comparing them with reference sensors and tools in HRV measurements. We compared the results obtained for the cardiac modulation data in time domain using samples of 10 elderly people's HRV data from Fitbit Inspire HR with the results provided by Kubios for the same population using a cardiac belt, with the data divided into train and test, where 75% of the data were used for training the models, with the remaining 25% as a test set for evaluating the final performance of the models. The results show that there is very little difference between the results obtained by the remote monitoring system compared with Kubios, indicating that the data obtained from these devices might provide accurate results in evaluating HRV in comparison with gold standard devices. We conclude that the application of the methods and techniques used and reported in this study are useful for the creation and validation of HRV indicators in time series obtained by means of wearable devices based on photoplethysmography sensors; therefore, they can be incorporated into remote monitoring processes as seen during the pandemic.},

Risk management identifies, assesses, and introduces responses for risks to avert crises. This study combines institutional theory, the resource-based view and the technology acceptance model to develop a novel behavioural model examining the adoption of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and blockchain for risk management from the operations manager's perspective, which has never been examined in the literature. The model was tested for each I4.0 technology using data collected from 117 operations managers in the UK manufacturing industry which were analysed using structural equation modelling. We contribute to the theory on I4.0 in digital manufacturing by showing the impact of digital transformation maturity, market pressure, regulations, and resilience on the perceived usefulness and adoption of these technologies for managing risks in business operations. Based on the findings, we discuss implications for operations managers effectively and efficiently to adopt I4.0 technologies aiming to boost operational productivity.},

   abstract = {Background: This study is a confirmatory efficacy trial of two treatments for winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD): SAD-tailored group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-SAD) and light therapy (LT). In our previous efficacy trial, post-treatment outcomes for CBT-SAD and LT were very similar, but CBT-SAD was associated with fewer depression recurrences two winters later than LT (27.3% in CBT-SAD vs. 45.6% in LT). CBT-SAD engaged and altered a specific mechanism of action, seasonal beliefs, which mediated CBT-SAD's acute antidepressant effects and CBT-SAD's enduring benefit over LT. Seasonal beliefs are theoretically distinct from LT's assumed target and mechanism: correction of circadian phase. This study applies the experimental therapeutics approach to determine how each treatment works when it is effective and to identify the best candidates for each. Biomarkers of LT's target and effect include circadian phase angle difference and the post-illumination pupil response. Biomarkers of CBT-SAD's target and effect include decreased pupillary and sustained frontal gamma-band EEG responses to seasonal words, which are hypothesized as biomarkers of seasonal beliefs, reflecting less engagement with seasonal stimuli following CBT-SAD. In addition to determining change mechanisms, this study tests the efficacy of a "switch" decision rule upon recurrence to inform clinical decision-making in practice. Method(s): Adults with SAD (target N = 160) will be randomzied to 6-weeks of CBT-SAD or LT in winter 1; followed in winter 2; and, if a depression recurrence occurs, offered cross-over into the alternate treatment (i.e., switch from LTCBT-SAD or CBT-SADLT). All subjects will be followed in winter 3. Biomarker assessments occur at pre-, mid-, and post-treatment in winter 1, at winter 2 follow-up (and again at mid-/post-treatment for those crossed-over), and at winter 3 follow-up. Primary efficacy analyses will test superiority of CBT-SAD over LT on depression recurrence status (the primary outcome). Mediation analyses will use parallel process latent growth curve modeling. Discussion(s): Consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's priorities for demonstrating target engagement at the level of Research Domain Criteria-relevant biomarkers, this work aims to confirm the targets and mechanisms of LT and CBT-SAD to maximize the impact of future dissemination efforts.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered us to explore a new teacher preparation paradigm aligned with Bloom's one-to-one and mastery learning vision. In 1984, Benjamin Bloom reported a phenomenon he named "The 2 sigma problem". In a series of studies, Bloom found that combining one-to-one tutoring and mastery learning techniques increased the average student performance by two standard deviations compared to traditional instructional methods. Bloom referred to this phenomenon as a problem given the infeasibility of implementing such instructional strategy on a large scale and invited educators to search for feasible alternative solutions. While pedagogical and technological innovations, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Massive Open Online Courses have emerged, traditional instructional methods (e.g., a teacher lecturing) and structures (e.g., class size), still dominate the public educational system. The proposed paradigm combines the development of teaching for mastery and teaching one-on-one competencies. For addressing mastery learning, the pre-service teachers created asynchronous short videos followed by tasks for high school CS pupils. For addressing one-to-one tutoring, each student was paired with a high school pupil and tutored himher for one hour per week for eight weeks synchronously via Zoom. The proposed teacher preparation model suggests a scalable and sustainable learning environment that enables a smooth transition from face-to-face to online learning while addressing the 2 sigma problem.},

In this developed model, an explainable decision forest classifier is employed to COVID-19 classification based on routinely available patient blood test data. The approach enables the clinician to use the decision tree and feature visualization to guide the explainability and interpretability of the prediction model. By utilizing this novel feature selection phase, the proposed diagnosis model will not only improve diagnosis accuracy but decrease the execution time as well.},

Despite a considerable body of research in the area of forecasting, the focus has largely been on the financial and economic outcomes of the forecasting process as opposed to societal benefits. Our motivation in this study is to promote the latter, with a view to using the forecasting process to advance social and environmental objectives such as equality, social justice and sustainability. We refer to such forecasting practices as Forecasting for Social Good (FSG) where the benefits to society and the environment take precedence over economic and financial outcomes. We conceptualise FSG and discuss its scope and boundaries in the context of the “Doughnut theory”. We present some key attributes that qualify a forecasting process as FSG: it is concerned with a real problem; it is focused on advancing social and environmental goals and prioritises these over conventional measures of economic success; and it has a broad societal impact. We also position FSG in the wider literature on forecasting and social good practices. We propose an FSG maturity framework as the means to engage academics and practitioners with research in this area. Finally, we highlight that FSG: (i) cannot be distilled to a prescriptive set of guidelines, (ii) is scalable, and (iii) has the potential to make significant contributions to advancing social objectives.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 vaccination raised serious concerns among the public and people are mind stuck by various rumors regarding the resulting illness, adverse reactions, and death. Such rumors are dangerous to the campaign against the COVID-19 and should be dealt with accordingly and timely. One prospective solution is to use machine learning-based models to predict the death risk for vaccinated people and clarify people's perceptions regarding death risk. This study focuses on the prediction of the death risks associated with vaccinated people followed by a second dose for two reasons; first to build consensus among people to get the vaccines; second, to reduce the fear regarding vaccines. Given that, this study utilizes the COVID-19 VAERS dataset that records adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination as 'recovered', 'not recovered', and 'survived'. To obtain better prediction results, a novel voting classifier extreme regression-voting classifier (ER-VC) is introduced. ER-VC ensembles extra tree classifier and logistic regression using soft voting criterion. To avoid model overfitting and get better results, two data balancing techniques synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) and adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) have been applied. Moreover, three feature extraction techniques term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), bag of words (BoW), and global vectors (GloVe) have been used for comparison. Both machine learning and deep learning models are deployed for experiments. Results obtained from extensive experiments reveal that the proposed model in combination with TF-TDF has shown robust results with a 0.85 accuracy when trained on the SMOTE-balanced dataset. In line with this, validation of the proposed voting classifier on binary classification shows state-of-the-art results with a 0.98 accuracy. Results show that machine learning models can predict the death risk with high accuracy and can assist the authors in taking timely measures.},

   abstract = {<p>Vaccination for the COVID-19 pandemic has raised serious concerns among the public and various rumours are spread regarding the resulting illness, adverse reactions, and death. Such rumours can damage the campaign against the COVID-19 and should be dealt with accordingly. One prospective solution is to use machine learning-based models to predict the death risk for vaccinated people by utilizing the available data. This study focuses on the prognosis of three significant events including ‘not survived’, ‘recovered’, and ‘not recovered’ based on the adverse events followed by the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Extensive experiments are performed to analyse the efficacy of the proposed Extreme Regression- Voting Classifier model in comparison with machine learning models with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Bag of Words, and Global Vectors, and deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory, and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory. Experiments are carried out on the original, as well as, a balanced dataset using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Approach. Results reveal that the proposed voting classifier in combination with TF-IDF outperforms with a 0.85 accuracy score on the SMOTE-balanced dataset. In line with this, the validation of the proposed voting classifier on binary classification shows state-of-the-art results with a 0.98 accuracy.</p>},

The clinical presentation and patients’ characteristics are usually utilized to identify those patients who need more critical care. However, the clinical evidence shows an unmet need to determine more accurate and optimal clinical biomarkers to triage patients under a condition like the COVID-19 crisis. Here we have presented a machine learning approach to find a group of clinical indicators from the blood tests of a set of COVID-19 patients that are predictive of poor prognosis and morbidity. Our approach consists of two interconnected schemes: Feature Selection and Prognosis Classification. The former is based on different Matrix Factorization (MF)-based methods, and the latter is performed using Random Forest algorithm. Our model reveals that Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) O2 Saturation and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) are the most important clinical biomarkers determining the poor prognosis in these patients. Our approach paves the path of building quantitative and optimized clinical management systems for COVID-19 and similar diseases.},

   abstract = {Having various sources to describe an object of interest may cause misinformation in real-world applications. This misinformation may come from conflicting sources (e.g., crowdsourcing platforms) or a reliable single source (e.g., fact verification). The conflict among different sources might be because of errors, out-of-date data, typos, missing records, etc. However, the misinformation from a single reliable source might be generated by a public figure like a politician or an individual user on their personal web page. Thus, identifying the true information is a challenge. To tackle this challenge, truth discovery, which aims to identify the truthfulness of an object, has emerged as a hot topic. There are two major approaches to truth discovery: 1- Truth discovery via aggregating multiple conflicting sources. 2- Truth discovery from a single source. The first approach applies aggregation to cancel out the source errors, and the latter does text reasoning to validate a statement using a reliable source.We first adapt truth discovery aggregation to aggregate sequential labels and constituency parse trees. In the first scenario, we aim to aggregate sequence labels from crowds in the absence of ground truth. An optimization-based sequential label aggregation (AggSLC) method is proposed that infers the best set of annotation aggregated using labels provided by workers. Next, truth discovery is adapted to aggregate constituency parse trees, a common data structure for parsing sentences in multiple NLP applications. An optimization-based method (CPTAM) is presented to aggregate the constituency parse trees in the absence of ground truth. In our last work, our approach to do truth discovery is via a single source. We use textual data (e.g. Wikipedia articles) to verify the credibility of a claim in fact verification. The goal is to integrate textual corpus, to validate a given statement. We propose a joint Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) based model (FVMIL) which jointly performs the evidence classification and claim verification sub-tasks. Experiments conducted on various datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.},

We explored how best to leverage adult data to improve the performance of such tools. This study assesses whether it is better to build CDS tools for children using data from children alone or to use combined data from both adults and children. Methods: Retrospective cohort using data from 2017 to 2020. Participants include all individuals (adults and children) receiving an elective surgery at a large academic medical center that provides adult and pediatric services. We predicted need for mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Predictor variables included demographic, clinical, and service utilization factors known prior to surgery. We compared predictive models built using machine learning to regression-based methods that used a pediatric or combined adult-pediatric cohort. We compared model performance based on Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic. Results: While we found that adults and children have different risk factors, machine learning methods are able to appropriately model the underlying heterogeneity of each population and produce equally accurate predictive models whether using data only from pediatric patients or combined data from both children and adults. Results from regression-based methods were improved by the use of pediatric-specific data. Conclusions: CDS tools for children can successfully use combined data from adults and children if the model accounts for underlying heterogeneity, as in machine learning models.},

The purpose of this study was to validate a new algorithm aimed to identify AF in patients measured with a recent FDA-cleared contact-free optical device.Study participants were measured simultaneously using two devices: a contact-free optical system that measures chest motion vibrations (investigational device, ‘Gili’) and a standard reference bed-side ECG monitor (Mindray®). Each reference ECG was evaluated by two board certified cardiologists that defined each trace as: regular rhythm, AF, other irregular rhythm or indecipherable/missing. A total of 3582, 30-s intervals, pertaining to 444 patients (41.9% with a history of AF) were made available for analysis. Distribution of patients with active AF, other irregular rhythm, and regular rhythm was 16.9%, 29.5%, and 53.6% respectively. Following application of cross-validated machine learning approach, the observed sensitivity and specificity were 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91–0.93] and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95–0.96), respectively.This study demonstrates for the first time the efficacy of a contact-free optical device for detecting AF.},

   abstract = {Remote simultaneous interpreting (RSI) draws on Information and Communication Technologies to facilitate multilingual communication by connecting conference interpreters to in-presence, virtual or hybrid events. Early solutions for RSI involved interpreters working in interpreting booths with ISO-standardised equipment. However, in recent years, cloud-based solutions for RSI have emerged, with innovative Simultaneous Interpreting Delivery Platforms (SIDPs) at their core, enabling RSI delivery from anywhere. SIDPs recreate the interpreter’s console and work environment (Braun 2019) as a bespoke software/videoconferencing platform with interpretation-focused features. Although initial evaluations of SIDPs were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic (e.g., DG SCIC 2019), research on RSI (booth-based and software-based) remains limited. Pre-pandemic research shows that RSI is demanding in terms of information processing and mental modelling (Braun 2007; Moser-Mercer 2005), and suggests that the limited visual input available in RSI constitutes a particular problem (Mouzourakis 2006; Seeber et al. 2019). Besides, initial explorations of the cloud-based solutions suggest that there is room for improving the interfaces of widely used SIDPs (Buján and Collard 2021; DG SCIC 2019). The experimental project presented in this paper investigates two aspects of SIDPs: the design of the interpreter interface and the integration of supporting technologies. Drawing on concepts and methods from user experience research and human-computer interaction, we explore what visual information is best suited to support the interpreting process and the interpreter-machine interaction, how this information is best presented in the interface, and how automatic speech recognition can be integrated into an RSI platform to aid/augment the interpreter’s source-text comprehension.},

The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has a great impact on the different aspects of our daily life, in particular, on our shopping behaviour. To predict electronic consumer behaviour could be of valuable help for managers in government, supply chain and retail industry. Although, before coronavirus pandemic we have experienced online shopping, during the disease the number of online shopping increased dramatically. Due to high speed transmission of COVID-19, we have to observe personal and social health issues such as social distancing and staying at home. These issues have direct effect on consumer behaviour in online shopping. In this paper, a prediction model is proposed to anticipate the consumers behaviour using machine learning methods. Five individual classifiers, and their ensembles with Bagging and Boosting are examined on the dataset collected from an online shopping site. The results indicate the model constructed using decision tree ensembles with Bagging achieved the best prediction of consumer behavior with the accuracy of 95.3%. In addition, correlation analysis is performed to determine the most important features influencing the volume of online purchase during coronavirus pandemic.},

The pharmaceutical supply chain processes are considered as the mediators and the emerging technology adoption barriers are proposed as the moderators. The study is evaluated using a survey of pharmaceutical companies in India. The findings indicate that manufacturing, distribution and consumption processes in the supply chain mediate the effects of emerging technologies on supply chain performance; however, mediating effects are weakened due to the presence of intricate barriers.

   abstract = {From the thermodynamic perspective, the term temperature is clearly defined for ideal physical systems: A unique temperature can be assigned to each black body via its radiation spectrum, and the temperature of an ideal gas is given by the velocity distribution of the molecules. While the indoor environment is not an ideal system, fundamental physical and chemical processes, such as diffusion, partitioning equilib-ria, and chemical reactions, are predictably temperature-dependent. For example, the logarithm of reaction rate and equilibria constants are proportional to the reciprocal of the absolute temperature. It is therefore possible to have non-linear, very steep changes in chemical phenomena over a relatively small temperature range. On the contrary, transport processes are more influenced by spatial temperature, momentum, and pressure gradients as well as by the density, porosity, and composition of indoor materials. Consequently, emergent phenomena, such as emission rates or dynamic air concentrations, can be the result of complex temperature-dependent relationships that require a more empirical approach. Indoor environmental conditions are further influenced by the thermal comfort needs of occupants. Not only do occupants have to create thermal conditions that serve to maintain their core body temperature, which is usually accomplished by wearing appropriate clothing, but also the surroundings must be adapted so that they feel comfortable. This includes the interaction of the living space with the ambient environment, which can vary greatly by region and season. Design of houses, apartments, commercial buildings, and schools is generally utility and comfort driven, requiring an appropriate energy balance, sometimes considering ventilation but rarely including the impact of temperature on indoor contaminant levels. In our article, we start with a review of fundamental thermodynamic variables and discuss their influence on typical indoor processes. Then, we describe the heat balance of people in their thermal environment. An extensive literature study is devoted to the thermal conditions in buildings, the temperature-dependent release of indoor pollutants from materials and their distribution in the various interior compartments as well as aspects of indoor chemistry. Finally, we assess the need to consider temperature holistically with regard to the changes to be expected as a result of global emergencies such as climate change.},

   abstract = {By the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), started in late 2019, people have been exposed to false information that not only made them confused about the scientific aspects of this virus but also endangered their life. This makes fake news detection a critical issue in social media. In this article, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for detecting fake news spread in social media. Considering the complexity of the fake news detection task, various features from different aspects of news articles should be captured. To this aim, we propose a multichannel CNN model that uses three distinct embedding channels: (1) contextualized text representation models; (2) static semantic word embeddings; and (3) lexical embeddings, all of which assist the classifier to detect fake news more accurately. Our experimental results on the COVID-19 fake news dataset (Patwa et al., 2020, Fighting an infodemic: COVID-19 fake news dataset, arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.03327) shows that our proposed three-channel CNN improved the performance of the single-channel CNN by 0.56 and 1.32% on the validation and test data, respectively. Moreover, we achieved superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art models in the field proposed by Shifath et al., 2021, A transformer based approach for fighting COVID-19 fake news, arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.12027 and Wani et al., 2021, Evaluating deep learning approaches for COVID-19 fake news detection, arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.04012.},

   abstract = {Owing to the nonlinear and non-stationary nature of the suspended sediment transport in rivers, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) modeling is a challenging task in environmental engineering. Investigation of SSC is of paramount importance in river morphology and hydraulic structures operation. To this end, for SSC modeling, first random forest (RF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) standalone models were developed, and then, they were optimized with genetic algorithm (GA) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to develop GA-MLP, GA-RF, SGD-MLP, and SGD-RF hybrid models. Variety of input scenarios are implemented for SSC prediction to find the best input combination. The streamflow and SSC data collected from two stations of Minnesota and San Joaquin rivers, respectively, located at South Dakota and California are utilized in the current study. Accuracies of the developed models are examined by means of three performance criteria of correlation coefficient (CC), scattered index (SI), and Willmott’s index of agreement (WI). A significant promotion in accuracy of hybrid models has been seen in contrast to their standalone counterparts. As can be deduced from the results, GA-MLP-5 and GA-RF-5 models with CC of 0.950 and 0.944, SI of 0.290 and 0.308, and WI of 0.974 and 0.971, respectively, were found as best models for prediction of SSC at Minnesota river. The developed SGD-MLP-5 and SGD-RF-5 models with CC of 0.900 and 0.901, SI of 0.339 and 0.339, and WI of 0.945 and 0.946, respectively, gave accurate results at San Joaquin river. Through the application of SGD algorithm, the adaptive learning rate, epochs, rho, L1 and L2 were activated and presumed as 0.004, 10, 1, 0.000009 and 0, respectively. The ExpRectifier was considered as san activation operation due to its better efficiency in comparison with its alternatives for predicting SSC in SGD-MLP model. According to the results, the fifth scenario that incorporates SSCt–1, SSCt–2, Qt, Qt–1, and Qt–2 were found superior for SSC modeling in the studied rivers. The recommended hybrid algorithms based on GA and SGD optimization algorithms are proposed as practical tools for solving complex environmental problems.},

People's behaviors will also be noticed, such as lying down because of illness, regarded as abnormal conditions. This paper proposes a visual anomaly analysis system based on deep learning to identify individuals with various anomaly types. In the study, two types of anomaly detections are concerned. The first is monitoring the anomaly in the case of falling in an open public area. The second is measuring the social distance of people in the area to warn the individuals under a short distance. By implementing a deep model named You Only Look Once, the related anomaly can be identified accurately in a wide range of open spaces. Experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed method is 91%. In the social distance, the actual social distance is calculated by calculating the plane distance to ensure that everyone can meet the specification. Integrating the two functions and implementing the environmental monitoring system will make it easier to monitor and manage the disease-related abnormalities on the site.},

   abstract = {The essay provides a take, by a historian, on the 2022 Ukraine war. It draws attention to the fact that, over the past 20 years, terms such as “game-changer” or “turning point” have been frequently employed to characterize important junctures. However, 2022 is qualitatively different from all of these, as it represents the antithesis to 1989 and marks the end of an entire era. From the leadership perspective, one immediate effect of a turning point is the reckoning with the past that it entails. It forces a rethink on past behavior. And this collective cognitive rewiring triggers the questioning of the legacy of leaders associated with the now discredited course of action. Taking the example of the crisis of conscience currently underway in Germany, the essay cautions against scapegoating that relies on retrospective selection bias; suggesting instead, that the focus of attention should be shifted to the collective cognitive blinders that prevented the numerous Cassandras, who understood the genuine nature of Putinist aggression, from being listened to. The essay then turns its attention to the proliferation of historical analogies and comparisons, arguing that this tells us less about the event and more about the fact that our compasses have gone haywire. As corollaries of our profound disarray, they even prevent us from gaining a better understanding of the phenomenon. This is addressed in the final part, which includes reflections on Putin as a leader, Putinist followership, as well as the challenges Western leaders are likely to face in the future.},

To increase their overall resilience against such unexpected disruptions, traditional approaches are no longer sufficient. To date, research on supply chain resilience has mainly focused on reactive responses and recovery strategies (post-disruption). Hence, the research gap addressed in this paper is that of identifying new and proactive strategies to enable pre-emptive resilience in military supply chains (pre-disruption). In this paper, the authors first provide a critical review of the pertinent literature and research conducted over the past 12 years.

   abstract = {The work reported in this article introduces the novel concept of phase portrait-based recurrence network (RN) analysis in the digital auscultation of expiratory wheeze (ES) and vesicular (VS), with its potential revealed through machine learning techniques (MLTs). The time-series lung sound signals of ES and VS, subjected to power spectral density analysis, revealed information regarding the morphology of the respiratory tract responsible for the generation of signature frequency components. Having constructed the complex network using Pearson's linear correlation coefficient (Pa,b) and employing the graph features for classification by principal component analysis (PCA), it is understood that the graph features thus obtained are incapable of classifying the two signals. Hence, a novel method, recurrence network, of constructing a network from the phase portrait of the time series is employed to deduce the network features. The MLTs, K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and PCA, are found to give better classification when RN topological features are used. When PCA separates the two signals with 84.7% total variance between the principal components, KNNyields 100% prediction accuracy. Thus, the study unveils the potential ofRNover Pa,b-based complex network in classifying the lung sound signals ES and VS and thereby opening the possibility of employing the technique in digital auscultation, a best-suited one for the time of the widespread pandemic coronavirus disease-2019.},

   abstract = {Background: Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to pandemics, including to the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, since it causes high mortality and specially, the loss of elderly Indigenous individuals. Methods: The epidemiological data of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection or other etiologic agents (OEA) among Brazilian Indigenous peoples during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from a Brazilian Ministry of Health open-access database to perform an observational study. Considering only Indigenous individuals diagnosed with SARS by COVID-19, the epidemiology data were also evaluated as risk of death. The type of sample collection for virus screening, demographic profile, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical evolution were evaluated. The primary outcome was considered the death in the Brazilian Indigenous individuals and the secondary outcome, the characteristics of Brazilian Indigenous infected by SARS-CoV-2 or OEA, as the need for intensive care unit admission or the need for mechanical ventilation support. The statistical analysis was done using Logistic Regression Model. Alpha of 0.05. Findings: A total of 3,122 cases of Indigenous individuals with SARS in Brazil were reported during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, 1,994 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 730/1,816 (40.2%) of them died. The death rate among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 was three-fold increased when compared to the group of individuals with OEA. Several symptoms (myalgia, loss of smell, and sore throat) and comorbidities (cardiopathy, systemic arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) were more prevalent in the COVID-19 group when compared to Indigenous individuals with OEA. Similar profile was observed considering the risk of death among the Indigenous individuals with COVID-19 who presented several symptoms (oxygen saturation <95%, dyspnea, and respiratory distress) and comorbidities (renal disorders, cardiopathy, and diabetes mellitus). The multivariate analysis was significant in differentiating between the COVID-19-positive and non-COVID-19 patients [X2(7)=65.187; P-value<0.001]. Among the patients’ features, the following contributed in relation to the diagnosis of COVID-19: age [≥43 years-old [y.o.]; OR=1.984 (95%CI=1.480-2.658)]; loss of smell [OR=2.373 (95%CI=1.461-3.854)]; presence of previous respiratory disorders [OR=0.487; 95%CI=0.287-0.824)]; and fever [OR=1.445 (95%CI=1.082-1.929)]. Also, the multivariate analysis was able to predict the risk of death [X2(9)=293.694; P-value<0.001]. Among the patients’ features, the following contributed in relation to the risk of death: male gender [OR=1.507 (95%CI=1.010-2.250)]; age [≥60 y.o.; OR=3.377 (95%CI=2.292-4.974)]; the need for ventilatory support [invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=24.050 (95%CI=12.584-45.962) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=2.249 (95%CI=1.378-3.671)]; dyspnea [OR=2.053 (95%CI=1.196-3.522)]; oxygen saturation <95% [OR=1.691 (95%CI=1.050-2.723)]; myalgia [OR=0.423 (95%CI=0.191-0.937)]; and the presence of kidney disorders [OR=3.135 (95%CI=1.144-8.539)]. Interpretation: The Brazilian Indigenous peoples are in a vulnerable situation during the COVID-19 pandemic and presented an increased risk of death due to COVID-19. Several factors were associated with enhanced risk of death, as male sex, older age (≥60 y.o.), and need for ventilatory support; also, other factors might help to differentiate SARS by COVID-19 or by OEA, as older age (≥43 y.o.), loss of smell, and fever.

   abstract = {Given the increasing research activity on epigenetics to monitor human diseases and its connection with lifestyle and environmental expositions, the field of epigenetics has attracted a great deal of interest also at the ethical and societal level. In this review, we will identify and discuss current ethical, legal and social issues of epigenetics research in the context of personalized medicine. The review covers ethical aspects such as how epigenetic information should impact patient autonomy and the ability to generate an intentional and voluntary decision, the measures of data protection related to privacy and confidentiality derived from epigenome studies (e.g., risk of discrimination, patient re-identification and unexpected findings) or the debate in the distribution of responsibilities for health (i.e., personal versus public responsibilities). We pay special attention to the risk of social discrimination and stigmatization as a consequence of inferring information related to lifestyle and environmental exposures potentially contained in epigenetic data. Furthermore, as exposures to the environment and individual habits do not affect all populations equally, the violation of the principle of distributive justice in the access to the benefits of clinical epigenetics is discussed. In this regard, epigenetics represents a great opportunity for the integration of public policy measures aimed to create healthier living environments. Whether these public policies will coexist or, in contrast, compete with strategies reinforcing the personalized medicine interventions needs to be considered. The review ends with a reflection on the main challenges in epigenetic research, some of them in a technical dimension (e.g., assessing causality or establishing reference epigenomes) but also in the ethical and social sphere (e.g., risk to add an epigenetic determinism on top of the current genetic one). In sum, integration into life science investigation of social experiences such as exposure to risk, nutritional habits, prejudice and stigma, is imperative to understand epigenetic variation in disease. This pragmatic approach is required to locate clinical epigenetics out of the experimental laboratories and facilitate its implementation into society.},

Deep learning (DL) is capable of pattern detection in complex medical data with high accuracy in noisy real-life environments, but little is known about DL’s utility in non-invasive biometric monitoring during pregnancy. A recently established self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to DL provides emotional recognition from electrocardiogram (ECG). We hypothesized that SSL will identify chronically stressed mother-fetus dyads from the raw maternal abdominal electrocardiograms (aECG), containing fetal and maternal ECG. Chronically stressed mothers and controls matched at enrolment at 32 weeks of gestation were studied. We validated the chronic stress exposure by psychological inventory, maternal hair cortisol and FSI. We tested two variants of SSL architecture, one trained on the generic ECG features for emotional recognition obtained from public datasets and another transfer-learned on a subset of our data. Our DL models accurately detect the chronic stress exposure group (AUROC = 0.982 ± 0.002), the individual psychological stress score (R2 = 0.943 ± 0.009) and FSI at 34 weeks of gestation (R2 = 0.946 ± 0.013), as well as the maternal hair cortisol at birth reflecting chronic stress exposure (0.931 ± 0.006). The best performance was achieved with the DL model trained on the public dataset and using maternal ECG alone. The present DL approach provides a novel source of physiological insights into complex multi-modal relationships between different regulatory systems exposed to chronic stress. The final DL model can be deployed in low-cost regular ECG biosensors as a simple, ubiquitous early stress detection and monitoring tool during pregnancy. This discovery should enable early behavioral interventions.},

   abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper is to map vulnerability of Asian countries to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 framework for natural hazards, vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. From an extensive literature review, we identified 16 socioeconomic, meteorological, environmental, and health factors that influence COVID-19 cases and deaths. The underlying factors of vulnerability were identified using principal component analysis. Results: Our findings indicate that the percentage of the urban population, obesity rate, air connectivity, and the population aged 65 and over, diabetes prevalence, and PM2.5 levels all contributed significantly to COVID-19 sensitivity. Subsequently, governance effectiveness, human development index (HDI), vaccination rate, and life expectancy at birth and gross domestic product (GDP) all had a positive effect on adaptive capacity. The estimated vulnerability was corroborated by a Pearson correlation of 0.615 between death per million population and vulnerability. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the application of universal indicators for assessing pandemic vulnerability for informed policy interventions such as the COVAX vaccine roll-out priority. Despite data limitations and a lack of spatiotemporal analysis, this study's methodological framework allows for ample data incorporation and replication.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 epidemic has a catastrophic impact on global well-being and public health. More than 27 million confirmed cases have been reported worldwide until now. Due to the growing number of confirmed cases, and challenges to the variations of the COVID-19, timely and accurate classification of healthy and infected patients is essential to control and treat COVID-19. We aim to develop a deep learning-based system for the persuasive classification and reliable detection of COVID-19 using chest radiography. Firstly, we evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proposed over recent years for medical image classification. Secondly, we develop and train CNN from scratch. In both cases, we use a public X-Ray dataset for training and validation purposes. For transfer learning, we obtain 100% accuracy for binary classification (i.e., Normal/ COVID-19) and 87.50% accuracy for tertiary classification (Normal/COVID-19/Pneumonia). With the CNN trained from scratch, we achieve 93.75% accuracy for tertiary classification. In the case of transfer learning, the classification accuracy drops with the increased number of classes. The results are demonstrated by comprehensive receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and confusion metric analysis with 10-fold cross-validation.},

   abstract = {The recent restrictions on mobility and economic activities imposed by governments due to the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly affected waste production and recycling patterns in cities worldwide. This effect differed both between cities and within cities as the measures of confinement adopted by governments had diverse impacts in different areas of cities, depending on their characteristics (e.g., touristic, or residential). In the present work, mixed waste collection areas were created, based on waste collection points, that define spatial units in which contextual data such as tourism and residential characteristics were aggregated. The difference in mixed waste collected compared with previous years was analyzed along with the impacts on recycling due to the modification in operations regarding waste collection during the lockdown. The results showed that despite the suspension of the door-to-door recycling system during the lockdown, this did not translate into an increase in the production of mixed waste, and the recycling levels of previous years have not been reached after the lockdown, indicating a possible change in recycling habits in Lisbon. The touristic and non-residential mixed waste circuits presented significantly reduced mixed waste production compared to the non-pandemic context. Also, tourist, mobility, and economic activity were measured to understand which factors contributed to waste production changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. While little evidence of a relationship with these exogenous variables was found at the citywide level, evidence was found at the waste collection circuit level.},

However, evidence in favor of this is mixed: they draw attention and may distract from the content. In contrast, using signaling (e.g., with a digital pointer) provides known benefits for learners. But effects of signaling were only researched in absence of an on-screen instructor. In the present explorative study, we investigated effects of an on-screen instructor on the division of learners´ attention; specifically, on following a digital pointer signal with their gaze. The presence of an instructor led to an increased number of fixations in the presenter area. This did neither affect learning outcomes nor gaze patterns following the pointer. The average distance between the learner's gaze and the pointer position predicts the student's quiz performance, independent of the presence of an on-screen instructor. This can also help in creating automated immediate-feedback systems for educational videos.},

   abstract = {Background The COVID 19 pandemic has triggered concerns and assumptions globally about transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus via cash transactions.Objectives Assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 through exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via cash acting as a fomite in payment transactions.Methods A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted for a worst-case scenario assuming an infectious person at the onset of symptoms, when virion concentrations in coughed droplets are at their highest. This person then contaminates a banknote by coughing on it and immediately hands it over to another person, who might then be infected by transferring the virions with a finger from the contaminated banknote to a facial mucous membrane. The scenario considered transfer efficiency of virions on the banknote to fingertips when droplets were still wet and after having dried up and subsequently being touched by finger printing or rubbing the object.Results Accounting for the likelihood of the worst-case scenario to occur by considering 1) a local prevalence of 100 COVID-19 cases/100,000 persons, 2) a maximum of about 1/5th of infected persons transmit high virus loads and 3) the numbers of cash transactions/person/day, the risk of contracting COVID-19 via person-to-person cash transactions was estimated to be much lower than once per 39,000 days (107 years) for a single person. In the general populace, there will be a maximum of 2.6 expected cases/100,000 persons/day. The risk for a cashier at an average point of sale was estimated to be much less than once per 430 working days (21 months).Discussion The worst-case scenario is a rare event, therefore, for a single person, the risk of contracting COVID-19 via person-to-person cash transactions is very low. At a point of sale, the risk to the cashier proportionally increases but it is still low.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:virus concentration data: reference given in the submissionI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Overuse of blood cultures (BCs) in emergency departments (EDs) leads to low yields and high numbers of contaminated cultures, accompanied by increased diagnostics, antibiotic usage, prolonged hospitalization, and mortality. We aimed to simplify and validate a recently developed machine learning model to help safely withhold BC testing in low-risk patients. METHODS We extracted data from the electronic health records (EHR) for 44.123 unique ED visits with BC sampling in the Amsterdam UMC (locations VUMC and AMC; the Netherlands), Zaans Medical Center (ZMC; the Netherlands), and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC; United States) in periods between 2011 and 2021. We trained a machine learning model on the VUMC data to predict blood culture outcomes and validated it in the AMC, ZMC, and BIDMC with subsequent real-time prospective evaluation in the VUMC. FINDINGS The model had an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.81 (95%-CI = 0.78-0.83) in the VUMC test set. The most important predictors were temperature, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. The AUROCs in the validation cohorts were 0.80 (AMC; 0.78-0.82), 0.76 (ZMC; 0.74-0.78), and 0.75 (BIDMC; 0.74-0.76). During real-time prospective evaluation in the EHR of the VUMC, it reached an AUROC of 0.76 (0.71-0.81) among 590 patients with BC draws in the ED. The prospective evaluation showed that the model can be used to safely withhold blood culture analyses in at least 30% of patients in the ED. INTERPRETATION We developed a machine learning model to predict blood culture outcomes in the ED, which retained its performance during external validation and real-time prospective evaluation. Our model can identify patients at low risk of having a positive blood culture. Using the model in practice can significantly reduce the number of blood culture analyses and thus avoid the hidden costs of false-positive culture results.

Methods: Descriptive statistical analysis was used to study a total of 2155 incident reports, submitted by 130 practices on mainland Europe. Results: Incidents caused harm in more than 40% of reports. Medication-related incidents were the most frequent type of incident recorded (40%). Treatment-related incidents were the most common type of incident causing patient harm (55%). Anaesthesia-related incidents were the most severe type of incident, resulting in patient death in 18% of these reports. Most incidents were reported from hospital wards, and a significantly higher proportion of cats were harmed by incidents compared to dogs. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that patients are regularly harmed by incidents, with medication-related incidents being most common. In depth understanding of incident data can help develop interventions to reduce the risk of incident recurrence.},

   abstract = {Background: Brazil has faced two simultaneous problems related to respiratory health: forest fires and the high mortality rate due to COVID-19 pandemics. The Amazon rain forest is one of the Brazilian biomes that suffers the most with fires caused by droughts and illegal deforestation. These fires can bring respiratory diseases associated with air pollution, and the State of Pará in Brazil is the most affected. COVID-19 pandemics associated with air pollution can potentially increase hospitalizations and deaths related to respiratory diseases. Here, we aimed to evaluate the association of fire occurrences with the COVID-19 mortality rates and general respiratory diseases hospitalizations in the State of Pará, Brazil. Methods: We employed machine learning technique for clustering k-means accompanied with the elbow method used to identify the ideal quantity of clusters for the k-means algorithm, clustering 10 groups of cities in the State of Pará where we selected the clusters with the highest and lowest fires occurrence from the 2015 to 2019. Next, an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous (ARIMAX) model was proposed to study the serial correlation of respiratory diseases hospitalizations and their associations with fire occurrences. Regarding the COVID-19 analysis, we computed the mortality risk and its confidence level considering the quarterly incidence rate ratio in clusters with high and low exposure to fires. Findings: Using the k-means algorithm we identified two clusters with similar DHI (Development Human Index) and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from a group of ten clusters that divided the State of Pará but with diverse behavior considering the hospitalizations and forest fires in the Amazon biome. From the auto-regressive and moving average model (ARIMAX), it was possible to show that besides the serial correlation, the fires occurrences contribute to the respiratory diseases increase, with an observed lag of six months after the fires for the case with high exposure to fires. A highlight that deserves attention concerns the relationship between fire occurrences and deaths. Historically, the risk of mortality by respiratory diseases is higher (about the double) in regions and periods with high exposure to fires than the ones with low exposure to fires. The same pattern remains in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the risk of mortality for COVID-19 was 80% higher in the region and period with high exposure to fires. Regarding the SARS-COV-2 analysis, the risk of mortality related to COVID-19 is higher in the period with high exposure to fires than in the period with low exposure to fires. Another highlight concerns the relationship between fire occurrences and COVID-19 deaths. The results show that regions with high fire occurrences are associated with more cases of COVID deaths. Interpretation: The decision-make process is a critical problem mainly when it involves environmental and health control policies. Environmental policies are often more cost-effective as health measures than the use of public health services. This highlight the importance of data analyses to support the decision making and to identify population in need of better infrastructure due to historical environmental factors and the knowledge of associated health risk. The results suggest that The fires occurrences contribute to the increase of the respiratory diseases hospitalization. The mortality rate related to COVID-19 was higher for the period with high exposure to fires than the period with low exposure to fires. The regions with high fire occurrences is associated with more COVID-19 deaths, mainly in the months with high number of fires. Funding: No additional funding source was required for this study.},

The pandemic forced widespread conversion of in-person to virtual care delivery through telemedicine. Given this gap, this article aims at providing a literature review of machine learning-based telemedicine applications to mitigate COVID-19. A rapid review of the literature was conducted in six electronic databases published from 2015 through 2020. The process of data extraction was documented using a PRISMA flowchart for inclusion and exclusion of studies. As a result, the literature search identified 1.733 articles, from which 16 articles were included in the review. We developed an updated taxonomy and identified challenges, open questions, and current data types. Our taxonomy and discussion contribute with a significant degree of coverage from subjects related to the use of machine learning to improve telemedicine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence identified by this rapid review suggests that machine learning, in combination with telemedicine, can provide a strategy to control outbreaks by providing smart triage of patients and remote monitoring. Also, the use of telemedicine during future outbreaks could be further explored and refined.},

Moreover, with the global spread of COVID-19 pandemic, social media contents have achieved an increasingly crucial factor in driving retail purchase decisions, thus it has become mandatory for fashion brand analysing social media pictures. In this light, this paper aims at presenting StyleTrendGAN, a novel custom deep learning framework that has the ability to generate fashion items. StyleTrendGAN combines a Dense Extreme Inception Network (DexiNed) for sketches extraction and Pix2Pix for the transformation of the input sketches into the new handbag models. StyleTrendGAN increases the efficiency and accuracy of the creation of new fashion models compared to previous ones and to the classic human approach; it aims to stimulate the creativity of designers and the visualization of the results of a production process without actually putting it into practice. The approach was applied and tested on a newly collected dataset, “MADAME” (iMage fAshion Dataset sociAl MEdia) of images collected from Instagram. The experiments yield high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed approach.},

The idea is to develop a decision support system allowing public health decision and policy-makers to have future statistics (the daily prediction of parameters) of the pandemic; and also encourage citizens for conducting health protocols. Many studies applied traditional epidemic models or machine learning models to forecast the evolution of coronavirus epidemic, but the use of such models alone to make the prediction will be less precise. For this purpose, we assume that the spread of the coronavirus is a moving target described by an epidemic model. On the basis of a SIRD model (Susceptible-Infection-Recovery- Death), we applied the EKF algorithm to predict daily all parameters. These predicted parameters will be much beneficial to hospital managers for updating the available means of hospitalization (beds, oxygen concentrator, etc.) in order to reduce the mortality rate and the infected. Simulations carried out reveal that the EKF seems to be more efficient according to the obtained results.</p>},

   abstract = {Digital forgery has become one of the attractive research fields in today's technology. There are several types of forgery in digital media transmission, especially digital image transmission. A common type of forgery is copy-move forgery (CMF). The CMF may be encountered in streets, railway stations, underground stations, or festivals. This type of forgery may lead to hugger-mugger in some cases. Therefore, there is a need to find a sufficient countermeasure mechanism to detect image forgeries. This paper presents a new CMFD approach that depends on deep learning for IoT based smart cities. Two well-known deep learning models, namely CNN and ConvLSTM, are adopted for CMFD. The proposed models are tested on MICC-220, MICC-600 and MICC 2000 datasets for validation. Several tests are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models. The simulation results reveal that the testing accuracy reaches 95%, 73%, and 94% for MICC-F220, MICC-F600 and MICC-F2000 datasets. In addition, the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 85% for a combined set of all datasets.},

This study examines customers’ perceptions and emotions by evaluating their experiences shared through online reviews. The online reviews of the customers on the hotel (41,687 reviews) and airline (9,574 reviews) sectors were analysed via text mining and sentiment analysis techniques. The study results reveal that most customers exhibit a positive attitude towards the services in the hotel sector, while 50% of the airline reviews were negative. The results indicated that ‘anticipation’ and ‘trust’ are the customers’ most expressed emotions.

To address this gap, this work comprehensively identifies the 16 prevalent social media roles in disaster preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, an integrated fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP), hereby termed the FDANP methodology, is used to perform the causal analysis of social media roles and to systemically measure the priority of these roles in emergency preparedness. Among the identified roles, those considered top priority are social media roles concerned with the facilitation of public health policy development, prevention of misinformation, and management of public behavior and response. These results were found to be robust, as evidenced by the sensitivity analysis. The implications of these findings were also detailed in this work in the context of a developing country.},

   abstract = {Background: Rise of conflict, extreme weather events, and pandemics have led to larger displaced populations worldwide. Displaced populations have unique acute and chronic health needs that must be met by low-resource health systems. Electronic health records (EHRs) have been shown to improve health outcomes in displaced populations, but need to be adapted to meet the constraints of these health systems. Objective: The aim of this viewpoint is to describe the development and deployment of an EHR designed to care for displaced populations in low-resource settings. Methods: Using a human-centered design approach, we conducted in-depth interviews and focus groups with patients, health care providers, and administrators in Lebanon and Jordan to identify the essential EHR features. These features, including modular workflows, multilingual interfaces, and offline-first capabilities, led to the development of the Hikma Health EHR, which has been deployed in Lebanon and Nicaragua. Results: We report the successes and challenges from 12 months of Hikma Health EHR deployment in a mobile clinic providing care to Syrian refugees in Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. Successes include the EHR's ability to (1) increase clinical efficacy by providing detailed patient records, (2) be adaptable to the threats of COVID-19, and (3) improve organizational planning. Lessons learned include technical fixes to methods of identifying patients through name or their medical record ID. Conclusions: As the number of displaced people continues to rise globally, it is imperative that solutions are created to help maximize the health care they receive. Free, open-sourced, and adaptable EHRs can enable organizations to better provide for displaced populations.},

Moreover, as the ongoing vaccination campaign is rolling slower than wished, affordable and effective therapeutics are needed. To this end, there is increasing attention toward computational methods for drug repositioning and de novo drug design. Here, multiple data-driven computational approaches are systematically integrated to perform a virtual screening and prioritize candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. From the list of prioritized drugs, a subset of representative candidates to test in human cells is selected. Two compounds, 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib, show synergistic antiviral effects in vitro and strongly inhibit viral-induced syncytia formation. Moreover, since existing drug repositioning methods provide limited usable information for de novo drug design, the relevant chemical substructures of the identified drugs are extracted to provide a chemical vocabulary that may help to design new effective drugs.},

Most roadway link-level vehicle energy consumption data are estimated using average annual daily traffic measures derived from the Highway Performance Monitoring System; however, this method does not reflect day-to-day energy consumption fluctuations. As transportation planners and operators are becoming more environmentally attentive, they need accurate real-time link-level vehicle energy consumption data to assess energy and emissions; to incentivize energy-efficient routing; and to estimate energy impact caused by congestion, major events, and severe weather. This paper presents a computational workflow to automate the estimation of time-resolved vehicle energy consumption for each link in a road network of interest using vehicle probe speed and count data in conjunction with machine learning methods in real time. The real-time pipeline can deliver energy estimates within a couple seconds on query to its interface. The proposed method was evaluated on the transportation network of the metropolitan area of Chattanooga, Tennessee. The volume estimation results were validated with ground truth traffic volume data collected in the field. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the energy consumption pipeline was applied to real-world data to quantify road transportation-related energy reduction because of mitigation policies to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to measure energy loss resulting from congestion.},

Some examples include writing essays, answering complex questions, matching pronouns to their nouns, and conducting sentiment analyses. However, questions remain with regard to its implementation in health care, specifically in terms of operationalization and its use in clinical practice and research. In this viewpoint paper, we briefly introduce GPT-3 and its capabilities and outline considerations for its implementation and operationalization in clinical practice through a use case. The implementation considerations include (1) processing needs and information systems infrastructure, (2) operating costs, (3) model biases, and (4) evaluation metrics. In addition, we outline the following three major operational factors that drive the adoption of GPT-3 in the US health care system: (1) ensuring Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, (2) building trust with health care providers, and (3) establishing broader access to the GPT-3 tools.

Contributing to the growing literature on instructor-facing systems, this paper reports on the development of a learning analytics (LA) technique called Student Inspection Facilitator (SIF) that provides an explainable interpretation of students learning behaviour to support instructors with the identification of students in need of attention. Unlike many previous predictive systems that automatically label students, our approach provides explainable recommendations to guide data exploration while still reserving judgement about interpreting student learning to instructors. The insights derived from applying SIF in an introductory Information Systems course with 407 enrolled students suggest that SIF can be utilised independent of the context and can provide a meaningful interpretation of students' learning behaviour towards facilitating proactive support of students.},

This paper reviews the different aspects of human life comprehensively affected by COVID-19. It then discusses various tools and technologies from the leading domains and their integration into people’s lives to overcome issues resulting from pandemics. This paper further focuses on providing a detailed review of existing and probable Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Blockchain-based solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic brings several challenges from the viewpoint of the nation’s healthcare, security, privacy, and economy. AI offers different predictive services and intelligent strategies for detecting coronavirus signs, promoting drug development, remote healthcare, classifying fake news detection, and security attacks. The incorporation of AI in the COVID-19 outbreak brings robust and reliable solutions to enhance the healthcare systems, increases user’s life expectancy, and boosts the nation’s economy. Furthermore, AR/VR helps in distance learning, factory automation, and setting up an environment of work from home. Blockchain helps in protecting consumer’s privacy, and securing the medical supply chain operations. IoT is helpful in remote patient monitoring, distant sanitising via drones, managing social distancing (using IoT cameras), and many more in combating the pandemic. This study covers an up-to-date analysis on the use of blockchain technology, AI, AR/VR, and IoT for combating COVID-19 pandemic considering various applications. These technologies provide new emerging initiatives and use cases to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The electric grid is one of the most complicated systems, and subsequently goes under-monitored in many regions around the world that cannot easily afford expensive meters. However, the electric grid is also critical for sustaining a high quality of life, and requires better monitoring than is often available to ensure consistent service is provided. Past work has shown that images taken by satellites during the night, capturing nighttime illumination (“nightlights”), could provide a proxy measurement of grid performance for minimal cost. We build upon earlier work by identifying the pixel z-score – a statistical measurement of a pixel's illumination relative to its history – as a key method for detecting electricity outages from the often-noisy nightlights dataset. We then train and validate our approach against observations from a network of on-the-ground power outage sensors in our observation area of Accra, Ghana, a dataset representing the largest collection of utility-independent electricity reliability measurements on the African continent. Using multiple machine learning techniques for estimating potential outages from nightlight images, we obtain high performance for predicting outages in Accra at scales as small as a single pixel (0.2 km2) and with training datasets as small as three months of illumination/sensor data. We further validate our methodology beyond the spatio-temporal coverage of the on-the-ground sensor deployment against a human-labeled dataset of outages by neighborhood throughout Accra. Delving deeper into the applications and limitations of available datasets and our work, we conclude by highlighting questions about the generality of our method vital to understanding its potential for low-cost worldwide measurements of grid reliability.},

With an increase in online learning and evaluation platforms especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the off-topic detection system can be very useful to check essays that are mainly submitted online. In this paper, we answer the question: given a prompt and an essay written in Pakistani English, can the process of detecting whether the essay is off-topic or not be reliably and completely autonomized with zero human intervention using currently available tools and techniques? For this purpose, we explore and implement various embedding techniques proposed in recent years to extract similarity or dissimilarity features between question and response, and compare the performance of these techniques using 10 benchmark data sets and 6 classifiers. With different classifiers and different datasets along with different embeddings, we conclude that combining word mover distance, average word embeddings and idf weighted word embeddings together and then using random forest as the classifier is the best combination for off-topic essay detection.

The healthcare sector is rapidly adopting telemedicine applications for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Most telemedicine applications are developed for heterogeneous environments and due to their diverse nature, data transmission between similar and dissimilar telemedicine applications is a difficult task. In this paper, we propose a Tele-COVID system architecture design along with its security aspects to provide the treatment for COVID-19 patients from distance. Tele-COVID secure system architecture is designed to resolve the problem of data interchange between two different telemedicine applications, interoperability, and vendor lock-in. Tele-COVID is a web-based and Android telemedicine application that provides suitable treatment to COVID-19 patients. With the help of Tele-COVID, the treatment of patients at a distance is possible without the need for them to visit hospitals; in case of emergency, necessary services can also be provided.

First, the FOMC had an implicit inflation target of approximately $1\frac\\{1\\}\\{2\\}$$\%$ on average over our baseline 2000–11 sample period, significantly below the commonly assumed value of 2. Second, the FOMC’s loss depends strongly on output growth and stock market performance and less so on their perception of current economic slack.},

   abstract = {Policymakers face a daunting task when it comes to achieving sustainable environmental development and avoiding additional environmental degradation. This study examines the significance of green technology innovation and green financing in creating a more sustainable environment. The impact of green technology innovation and green investment on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has yet to be empirically and theoretically examined in the literature, especially in conjunction with a moderating component, particularly social globalisation. Accordingly, this research examines the role of green technological innovation and green financing in reducing CO2 emissions in the G7 countries. Our study uses empirical research data from a panel of the G7 countries covering the period 1995 to 2019. We employ advanced panel approaches to address panel data analysis concerns, such as cross-sectional dependence, structural break, and slope heterogeneity (the Banerjee and Carrion-i-Silvestre unit root and cointegration test and cross-sectional augmented ARDL). This study shows that green technology innovation (GINV) as well as green financing (GFIN) have a negative but significant impact on CO2 emissions. Whilst economic growth has shown a positive and significant impact on CO2 emissions in the G7 countries, social globalisation positively moderates the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP, but negatively and significantly causes GFIN and GINV with CO2 emissions amongst the G7 countries. According to our study, countries would be able to meet the United Nations' SDG-7 and SDG-13 targets if they implemented green financing and green technology policies.},

   abstract = {The devastating outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) cases in early 2020 led the world to face health crises. Subsequently, the exponential reproduction rate of COVID-19 disease can only be reduced by early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection cases correctly. The initial research findings reported that radiological examinations using CT and CXR modality have successfully reduced false negatives by RT-PCR test. This research study aims to develop an explainable diagnosis system for the detection and infection region quantification of COVID-19 disease. The existing research studies successfully explored deep learning approaches with higher performance measures but lacked generalization and interpretability for COVID-19 diagnosis. In this study, we address these issues by the Covid-MANet network, an automated end-to-end multi-task attention network that works for 5 classes in three stages for COVID-19 infection screening. The first stage of the Covid-MANet network localizes attention of the model to the relevant lungs region for disease recognition. The second stage of the Covid-MANet network differentiates COVID-19 cases from bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, normal and tuberculosis cases, respectively. To improve the interpretation and explainability, three experiments have been conducted in exploration of the most coherent and appropriate classification approach. Moreover, the multi-scale attention model MA-DenseNet201 proposed for the classification of COVID-19 cases. The final stage of the Covid-MANet network quantifies the proportion of infection and severity of COVID-19 in the lungs. The COVID-19 cases are graded into more specific severity levels such as mild, moderate, severe, and critical as per the score assigned by the RALE scoring system. The MA-DenseNet201 classification model outperforms eight state-of-the-art CNN models, in terms of sensitivity and interpretation with lung localization network. The COVID-19 infection segmentation by UNet with DenseNet121 encoder achieves dice score of 86.15% outperforming UNet, UNet++, AttentionUNet, R2UNet, with VGG16, ResNet50 and DenseNet201 encoder. The proposed network not only classifies images based on the predicted label but also highlights the infection by segmentation/localization of model-focused regions to support explainable decisions. MA-DenseNet201 model with a segmentation-based cropping approach achieves maximum interpretation of 96% with COVID-19 sensitivity of 97.75%. Finally, based on class-varied sensitivity analysis Covid-MANet ensemble network of MA-DenseNet201, ResNet50 and MobileNet achieve 95.05% accuracy and 98.75% COVID-19 sensitivity. The proposed model is externally validated on an unseen dataset, yields 98.17% COVID-19 sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease is a viral infection caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) which was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China somewhere in the early December 2019. It affects the human respiratory system by causing respiratory infections with symptoms (mild to severe) like fever, cough, and weakness but can further lead to other serious diseases and has resulted in millions of deaths until now. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis for such types of diseases is highly needful for the current healthcare system. In this paper, a state of the art deep learning method is described. We propose COVDC-Net, a Deep Convolutional Network-based classification method which is capable of identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected amongst healthy and/or pneumonia patients from their chest X-ray images. The proposed method uses two modified pre-trained models (on ImageNet) namely MobileNetV2 and VGG16 without their classifier layers and fuses the two models using the Confidence fusion method to achieve better classification accuracy on the two currently publicly available datasets. It is observed through exhaustive experiments that the proposed method achieved an overall classification accuracy of 96.48% for 3-class (COVID-19, Normal and Pneumonia) classification tasks. For 4-class classification (COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia Viral, and Pneumonia Bacterial) COVDC-Net method delivered 90.22% accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed COVDC-Net method has shown better overall classification accuracy as compared to the existing deep learning methods proposed for the same task in the current COVID-19 pandemic.},

The SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant problems to medical systems and healthcare facilities due to its unexpected global expansion. Despite all of the efforts, developing effective treatments, diagnostic techniques, and vaccinations for this unique virus is a top priority and takes a long time. However, the foremost step in vaccine development is to identify possible antigens for a vaccine. The traditional method was time taking, but after the breakthrough technology of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in 2000, it drastically lowers the time needed to detect antigens ranging from 5–15 years to 1–2 years. The different RV tools work based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Models based on AI and ML have shown promising solutions in accelerating the discovery and optimization of new antivirals or effective vaccine candidates. In the present scenario, AI has been extensively used for drug and vaccine research against SARS-COV-2 therapy discovery. This is more useful for the identification of potential existing drugs with inhibitory human coronavirus by using different datasets. The AI tools and computational approaches have led to speedy research and the development of a vaccine to fight against the coronavirus. Therefore, this paper suggests the role of artificial intelligence in the field of clinical trials of vaccines and clinical practices using different tools.</p>},

As the pandemic progressed, the scientific community was faced by the limitations of existing diagnostic methods. In this review, we have compared the existing diagnostic techniques such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antigen and antibody detection, computed tomography scan, etc. and techniques in the research phase like microarray, artificial intelligence, and detection using novel materials; on the prospect of sample preparation, detection procedure (qualitative/quantitative), detection time, screening efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and ability to detect different variants. A detailed comparison of different techniques showed that RT-PCR is still the most widely used and accepted coronavirus detection method despite certain limitations (single gene targeting- in context to mutations). New methods with similar efficiency that could overcome the limitations of RT-PCR may increase the speed, simplicity, and affordability of diagnosis. In addition to existing devices, we have also discussed diagnostic devices in the research phase showing high potential for clinical use. Our approach would be of enormous benefit in selecting a diagnostic device under a given scenario, which would ultimately help in controlling the current pandemic caused by the coronavirus, which is still far from over with new variants emerging.},

   abstract = {False news that spreads on social media has proliferated over the past years and has led to multi-aspect threats in the real world. While there are studies of false news on specific domains (like politics or health care), little work is found comparing false news across domains. In this article, we investigate false news across nine domains on Weibo, the largest Twitter-like social media platform in China, from 2009 to 2019. The newly collected data comprise 44,728 posts in the nine domains, published by 40,215 users, and reposted over 3.4 million times. Based on the distributions and spreads of the multi-domain dataset, we observe that false news in domains that are close to daily life like health and medicine generated more posts but diffused less effectively than those in other domains like politics, and that political false news had the most effective capacity for diffusion. The widely diffused false news posts on Weibo were associated strongly with certain types of users — by gender, age, etc. Further, these posts provoked strong emotions in the reposts and diffused further with the active engagement of false-news starters. Our findings have the potential to help design false news detection systems in suspicious news discovery, veracity prediction, and display and explanation. The comparison of the findings on Weibo with those of existing work demonstrates nuanced patterns, suggesting the need for more research on data from diverse platforms, countries, or languages to tackle the global issue of false news.

   abstract = {Background: With the advent of data-intensive science, a full integration of big data science and health care will bring a cross-field revolution to the medical community in China. The concept big data represents not only a technology but also a resource and a method. Big data are regarded as an important strategic resource both at the national level and at the medical institutional level, thus great importance has been attached to the construction of a big data platform for health care. Objective: We aimed to develop and implement a big data platform for a large hospital, to overcome difficulties in integrating, calculating, storing, and governing multisource heterogeneous data in a standardized way, as well as to ensure health care data security. Methods: The project to build a big data platform at West China Hospital of Sichuan University was launched in 2017. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform has extracted, integrated, and governed data from different departments and sections of the hospital since January 2008. A master–slave mode was implemented to realize the real-time integration of multisource heterogeneous massive data, and an environment that separates heterogeneous characteristic data storage and calculation processes was built. A business-based metadata model was improved for data quality control, and a standardized health care data governance system and scientific closed-loop data security ecology were established. Results: After 3 years of design, development, and testing, the West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform was formally brought online in November 2020. It has formed a massive multidimensional data resource database, with more than 12.49 million patients, 75.67 million visits, and 8475 data variables. Along with hospital operations data, newly generated data are entered into the platform in real time. Since its launch, the platform has supported more than 20 major projects and provided data service, storage, and computing power support to many scientific teams, facilitating a shift in the data support model—from conventional manual extraction to self-service retrieval (which has reached 8561 retrievals per month). Conclusions: The platform can combine operation systems data from all departments and sections in a hospital to form a massive high-dimensional high-quality health care database that allows electronic medical records to be used effectively and taps into the value of data to fully support clinical services, scientific research, and operations management. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform can successfully generate multisource heterogeneous data storage and computing power. By effectively governing massive multidimensional data gathered from multiple sources, the West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform provides highly available data assets and thus has a high application value in the health care field. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform facilitates simpler and more efficient utilization of electronic medical record data for real-world research.},

Therefore, the ability to avoid collisions with obstacles in crowded, partially observable environments is one of the most important indicators to measure the navigation performance of a mobile robot. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning architecture that combines a spatial graph and attention rea-soning to tackle this problem. We take the relative positions and velocities of observed humans as nodes of the spatial graph and robot-human pairs as nodes of the attention graph to capture the spatial relations between the robot and the humans. In this way, our approach enhances the modeling of the relationship between the moving robot, static obstacles, and the people in the surrounding. As a result, our proposed navigation framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches [1], [2] in crowded scenarios when the robot has only a limited sensor range in terms of a reduced collision rate. Furthermore, we realize a seriously decreased training time by applying parallel Double Deep Q-Learning.},

   abstract = {At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals were in dire need of data-driven analytics to provide support for critical, expensive, and complex decisions. Yet, the majority of analytics being developed were targeted at state- and national-level policy decisions, with little availability of actionable information to support tactical and operational decision-making and execution at the hospital level. To fill this gap, we developed a multi-method framework leveraging a parsimonious design philosophy that allows for rapid deployment of high-impact predictive and prescriptive analytics in a time-sensitive, dynamic, data-limited environment, such as a novel pandemic. The product of this research is a workload prediction and decision support tool to provide mission-critical, actionable information for individual hospitals. Our framework forecasts time-varying patient workload and demand for critical resources by integrating disease progression models, tailored to data availability during different stages of the pandemic, with a stochastic network model of patient movements among units within individual hospitals. Both components employ adaptive tuning to account for hospital-dependent, time-varying parameters that provide consistently accurate predictions by dynamically learning the impact of latent changes in system dynamics. Our decision support system is designed to be portable and easily implementable across hospital data systems for expeditious expansion and deployment. This work was contextually grounded in close collaboration with IU Health, the largest health system in Indiana, which has 18 hospitals serving over one million residents. Our initial prototype was implemented in April 2020 and has supported managerial decisions, from the operational to the strategic, across multiple functionalities at IU Health.},

Recently, deep learning techniques have been exploited to automatically generate summaries for given code snippets. To achieve a profound understanding of how far we are from solving this problem and provide suggestions to future research, in this paper, we conduct a systematic and in-depth analysis of 5 state-of-the-art neural code summarization models on 6 widely used BLEU variants, 4 pre-processing operations and their combinations, and 3 widely used datasets. The evaluation results show that some important factors have a great influence on the model evaluation, especially on the performance of models and the ranking among the models. However, these factors might be easily overlooked. Specifically, (1) the BLEU metric widely used in existing work of evaluating code summarization models has many variants. Ignoring the differences among these variants could greatly affect the validity of the claimed results. Besides, we discover and resolve an important and previously unknown bug in BLEU calculation in a commonly-used software package. Furthermore, we conduct human evaluations and find that the metric BLEU-DC is most correlated to human perception; (2) code preprocessing choices can have a large (from -18% to +25%) impact on the summarization performance and should not be neglected. We also explore the aggregation of pre-processing combinations and boost the performance of models; (3) some important characteristics of datasets (corpus sizes, data splitting methods, and duplication ratios) have a significant impact on model evaluation. Based on the experimental results, we give actionable suggestions for evaluating code summarization and choosing the best method in different scenarios. We also build a shared code summarization toolbox to facilitate future research.},

   abstract = {<p>With the progress of the Internet and information technology, emotion analysis has been applied to analyse the emotional orientation and evolution trend of online public opinion of online tweets. At present, most of the existing methods use econometric model and machine learning algorithm to predict the trend of online public opinion. Although these methods have achieved good prediction results, they do not take into account the influence of internal factors on network public opinion prediction, such as mutual migration among emotion classes. The emotion may change dynamically because different events trigger it in the evolution process. In this view, this article proposes a novel method, called Deviation Rule Markov Model (DRMM), to predict the emotional change trend of Internet users in online public opinion by analysing the correlation between Internet users’ emotional categories. Structurally, the proposed DRMM involves various processes such as pre-processing, emotion classification, data mining and transfer prediction. For the processing of network comment data, the proposed model initially undergoes pre-processing to delete unnecessary data. Then, the extended fuzzy emotion ontology is used to annotate the emotion class of the comment data. Besides, an extended association rule mining algorithm is used in the emotion association analysis process to obtain the transfer probability between emotion classes. Moreover, Markov chain is used to construct an emotional state transition matrix to predict the transition probability of positive or negative emotions. According to the predicted single emotion transfer probability results, the analytic hierarchy process is used to assign values to different emotion classes, and finally, the transfer probability of the overall emotion in a certain period is obtained. Compared with the actual case, the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed model are 2.7119 and 3.7254, respectively, which has good prediction performance.</p>},

   abstract = {This research explores the social mechanism of luxury hotel membership programs and extends current loyalty program literature that has mainly examined membership programs from a mental-accounting perspective. By building upon the social identity theory, this study posits that luxury hotel membership programs provide social platforms, allowing members to construct a collective identity and collective self-esteem. Consequently, collective self-esteem is proposed as an antecedent of customer–brand relationship constructs, such as commitment, switching resistance, and word of mouth. Members from two South Korean luxury hotel membership programs were recruited to participate in a survey to test these constructs’ relationship, and findings demonstrate that membership programs’ effectiveness in cultivating a robust customer–brand relationship is contingent upon members’ collective self-esteem with the program. This correlation involves the four dimensions of collective self-esteem: membership esteem, private esteem, public esteem, and importance to identity. This study is preeminent to the current literature by identifying a critical psychological mechanism, which luxury hotel brand managers can leverage to successfully launch a membership program that ultimately cultivates enduring customer–brand relationships. The results of this study also suggest several managerial implications for hotel marketers to effectively design and manage membership programs by considering collective self-esteem’s four dimensions.},

Methods: Whole lung segmentations were performed automatically using a deep learning-based model to extract 107 intensity and texture radiomics features. We used four feature selection algorithms and seven classifiers. We evaluated the models using ten different splitting and cross-validation strategies, including non-harmonized and ComBat-harmonized datasets. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were reported. Results: In the test dataset (4,301) consisting of CT and/or RT-PCR positive cases, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.83 ± 0.01 (CI95%: 0.81–0.85), 0.81, and 0.72, respectively, were obtained by ANOVA feature selector + Random Forest (RF) classifier. Similar results were achieved in RT-PCR-only positive test sets (3,644). In ComBat harmonized dataset, Relief feature selector + RF classifier resulted in the highest performance of AUC, reaching 0.83 ± 0.01 (CI95%: 0.81–0.85), with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. ComBat harmonization did not depict statistically significant improvement compared to a non-harmonized dataset. In leave-one-center-out, the combination of ANOVA feature selector and RF classifier resulted in the highest performance. Conclusion: Lung CT radiomics features can be used for robust prognostic modeling of COVID-19. The predictive power of the proposed CT radiomics model is more reliable when using a large multicentric heterogeneous dataset, and may be used prospectively in clinical setting to manage COVID-19 patients.},

   abstract = {Universalism is a principle according to which a rule or a standard should be applied in social situations in the same way irrespective of the social attributes of those who are affected by this rule/standard. This normative claim collides with the fundamental mechanisms of social cognition, which underlie social biases, prejudice, and discrimination. Social biases are the main source of violation from the universalism principle across various domains of human life: evaluations, judgments, decision-making, problem-solving, social interaction, among others. Whereas normative universalism is a moral principle, the present study asks how it can be realised in practice. The study identifies three broad classes of such strategies. The first one targets individuals' cognitive and psychological traits, which give rise to social biases and include intergroup contact, social cognitive strategy, reappraisal, motivational strategy, and bias control. The second class targets the situation and includes three strategies: disengagement, randomisation, and counterbalancing biases by aggregation. The third class includes two strategies, which rely on technological solutions: automation and neural administration. The study describes the core idea and main problems of each strategy and discusses how the choice of a strategy depends on the context and the task, which requires a universal solution.},

Pickstar aims to make vocabulary learning training more accessible to families with ASD, in a way that increases engagement by offering a multisensory experience and by adapting to the level of each player. The game includes two learning approaches: the classical levels advancement approach where the levels gradually increase in difficulty and Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) approach that adapts to the skill level of the player as determined via feature extraction. Through the AdaptiveMiniMax algorithm, Pickstar's DDA feature ensures that everyone has the same winning rate of approximately 70%, encouraging players of all levels to play again. The engagement rate of children with ASD in the learning process was 88.4% higher for DDA compared with classical levels. Usability evaluation of Pickstar, based on ISO 25062:2006, on caregiver interviews concluded that Pickstar not only decreases caregivers’ teaching and assessment loads, but also increases the time children spend on learning. Caregiver interviews, usability testing, and engagement assessments show that Pickstar can be used with minimal guidance to improve vocabulary skills of individuals with ASD and can mitigate caregiver problems in accessing good-quality, engaging, and affordable education for their children.},

In the most recent desert locust episode, which originated in Saudi Arabia's remote interior in June 2018, and swarms entered Pakistan in March 2019, devastating important crops, such as cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L.; wheat, Triticum aestivum L.; and maize, Zea mays L., in >60 districts of Baluchistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh provinces. A national emergency was declared on 1 February 2020. A national emergency was declared on 1 February 2020 and the Department of Plant Protection responded by conducting surveillance and control operations with the assistance of other Pakistani organizations, and multilateral and bilateral international aid agencies. Surveillance and control operations were performed by ground and by air, applying mostly oil-based ultra-low volume insecticide formulations combined with some nonconventional control tactics. The Pakistan government also established a detailed multi-phased locust control policy and a National Locust Control Center with rapid response units deployed to vulnerable districts. To prevent or mitigate desert locust-associated agricultural damage, additional improvements to surveillance and control approaches are needed. The desert locust's unique behaviors, and the magnitude and intermittency of swarming episodes, pose challenges to the development and implementation of coherent integrated pest management strategies. The status of a possible integrated approach to desert locust management, including proactive and preventive intervention strategies, is discussed.},

Today, we must respond to climate change, manage a global pandemic, and address disparities and inequities that threaten our planet in ways we are yet to comprehend fully. However, the JPP&M community remains well placed to inform responses to these crises. This article draws together perspectives on new and long-standing questions and challenges, as it highlights the increasing urgency of addressing inequities and embedding sustainability at the heart of policy making. Although progress addressing these complex questions often has been slow, the authors also identify compelling opportunities in the form of sound policies and good marketing and consumption practices in response to health crises, environmental degradation, injustice, automation, violence, and war. The transformational benefits following constructive engagement offer hope that, even when faced with unprecedented challenges, human resilience and ingenuity can create meaningful responses. As the authors address chronic and novel problems, they are confident that JPP&M's community of researchers, policy makers, and advocates will continue to bring innovation, insight, and rigor and play a leading role in discovering solutions, locally and globally.},

The last decade has witnessed significant endeavors in striking a balance between ethical considerations and health transformation led by AI. Despite a growing interest in AI ethics, implementing AI-related technologies and initiatives responsibly in healthcare settings remains a challenge. In response to this topical challenge, we reviewed 253 articles pertaining to AI ethics in healthcare published between 2000 and 2020, summarizing the coherent themes of responsible AI initiatives. A preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach was employed to screen and select articles, and a hermeneutic approach was adopted to conduct systematic literature review. By synthesizing relevant knowledge from AI governance and ethics, we propose a responsible AI initiative framework that encompasses five core themes for AI solution developers, healthcare professionals, and policy makers. These themes are summarized in the acronym SHIFT: Sustainability, Human centeredness, Inclusiveness, Fairness, and Transparency. In addition, we unravel the key issues and challenges concerning responsible AI use in healthcare, and outline avenues for future research.},

Analyses of hospitalized patients show that a substantial number without prior indication of heart disease or comorbidities show significant injury to heart tissue, assessed by increased levels of troponin in blood.COVID-19 affects multiple organs. Clinical data from the Mount Sinai Health System show that substantial numbers of COVID-19 patients without prior heart disease develop cardiac dysfunction. How COVID-19 patients develop cardiac disease is not known. We integrated cell biological and physiological analyses of human cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the presence of interleukins (ILs) with clinical findings related to laboratory values in COVID-19 patients to identify plausible mechanisms of cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients. We infected hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from healthy human subjects with SARS-CoV-2 in the absence and presence of IL-6 and IL-1β. Infection resulted in increased numbers of multinucleated cells. Interleukin treatment and infection resulted in disorganization of myofibrils, extracellular release of troponin I, and reduced and erratic beating. Infection resulted in decreased expression of mRNA encoding key proteins of the cardiomyocyte contractile apparatus. Although interleukins did not increase the extent of infection, they increased the contractile dysfunction associated with viral infection of cardiomyocytes, resulting in cessation of beating. Clinical data from hospitalized patients from the Mount Sinai Health System show that a significant portion of COVID-19 patients without history of heart disease have elevated troponin and interleukin levels. A substantial subset of these patients showed reduced left ventricular function by echocardiography. Our laboratory observations, combined with the clinical data, indicate that direct effects on cardiomyocytes by interleukins and SARS-CoV-2 infection might underlie heart disease in COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple organs, including the heart. Analyses of hospitalized patients show that a substantial number without prior indication of heart disease or comorbidities show significant injury to heart tissue, assessed by increased levels of troponin in blood. We studied the cell biological and physiological effects of virus infection of healthy human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in culture. Virus infection with interleukins disorganizes myofibrils, increases cell size and the numbers of multinucleated cells, and suppresses the expression of proteins of the contractile apparatus. Viral infection of cardiomyocytes in culture triggers release of troponin similar to elevation in levels of COVID-19 patients with heart disease. Viral infection in the presence of interleukins slows down and desynchronizes the beating of cardiomyocytes in culture. The cell-level physiological changes are similar to decreases in left ventricular ejection seen in imaging of patients’ hearts. These observations suggest that direct injury to heart tissue by virus can be one underlying cause of heart disease in COVID-19.},

Science- and evidence-based, agricultural water management (AWM) can significantly contribute to reduce unsustainable water use and help enhance water resilience and adaptation to climate change. This paper presents a brief overview of potential AWM practices focusing on enhancing water resilience, increasing yields, and wherever possible, reducing emissions. This is achieved via increased land and water use efficiency, water and energy savings, and improved water productivity with considerable scope to improve agricultural resilience. In this context, the prioritization of a location-specific portfolio of smart AWM practices to make the right investment decisions is very important. We present two distinct and complementary approaches to prioritize AWM practices in this paper: one follows stakeholder analysis to build a prioritized portfolio of climate-smart AWM practices and the other employs a simple water balance-based approach to prioritize interventions. The way forward in mainstreaming and scaling out context-specific climate-smart AWM interventions is also discussed with a focus on capacity building, water management extension services, and the mobilization of resources through the convergence of institutions and co-financing from relevant development schemes.},

   abstract = {<p>Epidemiological surveillance and notification of respiratory infections are important for management and control of epidemics and pandemics. Fact-based decisions, like social distancing policies and preparation of hospital beds, are taken based on several factors, including case numbers; hence, health authorities need quick access to reliable and well-analysed data. We aimed to analyse the role of the Brazilian public health system in the notification and hospitalization of patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Data of SARI cases in Brazil (2013–20) were obtained from SIVEP-Gripe platform, and legal status of each healthcare unit (HCU) responsible for case notification and hospitalization was obtained from the National Registry of Health Facilities (CNES) database. HCUs that are part of the hospital network were classified as ‘Public Administration’, ‘Business Entities’, ‘Philanthropic Entities’ or ‘Individuals’. SARI notification data from Brazilian macro-regions (North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and South) were analysed and compared between administrative spheres. This study reveals that hospitalizations due to SARI increased significantly in Brazil during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, especially in HCUs of Public Administration. In the Southeast and South, where incidence of SARI is high, philanthropic HCUs also contribute to hospitalization of SARI cases and attend up to 7.4% of the cases notified by the Public Administration. The number of cases is usually lower in other regions, but in 2020 the Northeast showed more hospitalizations than the South. In the South, SARI season occurs later; however, in 2020, an early peak was observed because of COVID-19. Notably, the contribution of each administrative sphere that manages hospital networks in Brazil in the control and management of SARI varies between regions. Our approach will allow managers to assess the use of public resources, given that there are different profiles of healthcare in each region of Brazil and that the public health system has a major role in notifying and attending SARI cases.</p>},

The model included face-to-face lessons and homework done online distance. In total, 123 learners from the Slovak Republic (aged 10–12) participated in the research. In homework, the learners practised and fixed the learning content that was explained in face-to-face lessons. They worked either with printed materials or used an e-application. Two tools were exploited within the research: (1) didactic tests, that is, pretest that detected learners entrance knowledge, and posttest, that monitored their final knowledge; (2) a semi-structured interview in the focus group that proportionally included 16 learners. Five hypotheses were set to discover whether the learners achieved the expected learning objectives and outcomes. The results discovered that within the blended learning model learners achieved the required knowledge, irrespective they worked with printed materials or with e-application. Moreover, all test results were in favour of the e-app. Furthermore, in the semi-structured interview in the focus group, the learners reflected their experience with the blended learning model in four areas: hardware and software equipment, digital skills, autonomy in learning, and home environment. The results aspire to be applied in blended learning in the new normal era of post-pandemic education.},

   abstract = {The novel coronavirus outbreak has spread worldwide, causing respiratory infections in humans, leading to a huge global pandemic COVID-19. According to World Health Organization, the only way to curb this spread is by increasing the testing and isolating the infected. Meanwhile, the clinical testing currently being followed is not easily accessible and requires much time to give the results. In this scenario, remote diagnostic systems could become a handy solution. Some existing studies leverage the deep learning approach to provide an effective alternative to clinical diagnostic techniques. However, it is difficult to use such complex networks in resource constraint environments. To address this problem, we developed a fine-tuned deep learning model inspired by the architecture of the MobileNet V2 model. Moreover, the developed model is further optimized in terms of its size and complexity to make it compatible with mobile and edge devices. The results of extensive experimentation performed on a real-world dataset consisting of 2482 chest Computerized Tomography scan images strongly suggest the superiority of the developed fine-tuned deep learning model in terms of high accuracy and faster diagnosis time. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 96.40%, with approximately ten times shorter response time than prevailing deep learning models. Further, McNemar’s statistical test results also prove the efficacy of the proposed model.},

   abstract = {In a post-COVID-19 world, extensive study of deep learning-based biometric authentication techniques prompts the need to secure them. Further, the biometric data is assumed to be largely immutable; thus, if it is compromised, it is lost forever. Hence, reliable and secure biometric authentication is of utmost importance. In this paper, we address the security and privacy concerns of biometric templates generated via deep networks. We propose a cancelable biometric authentication approach. The framework consists of a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a few-shot enrollment for generating biometric templates. Further, to enhance biometric templates’ discriminative power and to provide revocability, biometric templates are projected onto a random subspace (based on the user-specific key). Later projected biometric templates are mapped onto robust n-bit unique codes (using a KNN classifier) and protected via. SHA-3 hash digest. Moreover, a real-world biometric authentication system is always dynamic (users keep on changing). Thus we have also integrated phase-wise incremental learning within a deep learning-based cancelable biometric authentication framework. This is the first work in which deep cancelable templates are generated incrementally to the best of our knowledge. We analyze the proposed scheme for its performance and privacy preservation on three benchmarks constrained iris data-sets and over one unconstrained iris data-set along with one publicly available knuckle data-set. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the proposed cancelable incremental framework strictly follows the four fundamental properties of cancelability viz. non-invertibility, unlinkability, revocability, and usability.},

   abstract = {Computer-aided design (CAD) programs are essential to engineering as they allow for better designs through low-cost iterations. While CAD programs are typically taught to undergraduate students as a job skill, such software can also help students learn engineering concepts. A current limitation of CAD programs (even those that are specifically designed for educational purposes) is that they are not capable of providing automated real-time help to students. To encourage CAD programs to build in assistance to students, we used data generated from students using a free, open-source CAD software called Aladdin to demonstrate how student data combined with machine learning techniques can predict how well a particular student will perform in a design task. We challenged students to design a house that consumed zero net energy as part of an introductory engineering technology undergraduate course. Using data from 128 students, along with the scikit-learn Python machine learning library, we tested our models using both total counts of design actions and sequences of design actions as inputs. We found that our models using early design sequence actions are particularly valuable for prediction. Our logistic regression model achieved a >60% chance of predicting if a student would succeed in designing a zero net energy house. Our results suggest that it would be feasible for Aladdin to provide useful feedback to students when they are approximately halfway through their design. Further improvements to these models could lead to earlier predictions and thus provide students feedback sooner to enhance their learning.},

   abstract = {The growing popularity of online social networks is evident nowadays and allows researchers to find solutions for various practical applications. Link prediction is the technique of understanding network structure and identifying the missing links in the social network. The two significant challenges of the link prediction problem are accuracy and efficiency on growing and multiplex networks. Well-known methods for link prediction are the similarity-based methods, which use local, global, and topological features of the network to predict missing links. These approaches ignore critical factors such as different channels of interaction, information diffusion, group norms to form new connections. Therefore, a fuzzy-based link prediction algorithm (FLP-ID) in multiple social networks is proposed using information diffusion. First, FLP-ID generates a multiplex network by combining different types of relationships among users and identifying the community structure. Thereafter, the algorithm computes node and relative relevance for distinct fuzzy criteria under group norms. Finally, the likelihood score of each non-existing link is computed to predict missing links. The experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy algorithm accuracy is better than crisp algorithms over the multiplex network. The prediction rate of FLP-ID with F1-score, AUC, and balanced accuracy is excellent, which are improved compared to related methods up to 30%, 35%, and 30%, respectively, on high density and clustering coefficient datasets under multiplex settings.},

Closure of outpatient services and postponement of elective surgical procedures have dried up opportunities for training vitreoretinal trainees across the country. This 'loss' has adversely impacted trainees' morale and mental health, leading to feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. Therefore, there is an urgent need to redraw the surgical training program. We aimed to describe a systematic stepwise approach to vitreoretinal surgical training. Methods: We introduced a three-pronged approach to vitreoretinal surgical training comprising learn from home, wet lab and simulator training, and hands-on transfer of surgical skills in the operating room in our institute. Results: Encouraging results were obtained as evaluated by feedback from the trainees about the usefulness of this three-pronged approach in developing surgical skills and building their confidence. Conclusion: The disruption caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic should be used as an opportunity to evolve and reformulate surgical training programs to produce competent vitreoretinal surgeons of the future.},

A common symptom noticed among COVID-19 patients is lung infection that results in breathlessness, and the lack of essential resources such as testing, oxygen, and ventilators enhances its severity. Chest X-ray can be used to design and develop a COVID-19 detection mechanism for a quicker diagnosis using AI and machine learning techniques. Due to this silver lining, various new COVID-19 detection techniques and prediction models have been introduced in recent times based on chest radiography images. However, due to a high level of unpredictability and the absence of essential data, standard models have showcased low efficiency and also suffer from overheads and complexities. This paper proposes a model fine tuning transfer learning-coronavirus 19 (Ftl-CoV19) for COVID-19 detection through chest X-rays, which embraces the ideas of transfer learning in pretrained VGG16 model with including combination of convolution, max pooling, and dense layer at different stages of model. Ftl-CoV19 reported promising experimental results; it observed training and validation accuracy of 98.82% and 99.27% with precision of 100%, recall of 98%, and F1 score of 99%. These results outperformed other conventional state of arts such as CNN, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and Xception.</p>},

However stock prices depend on various factors that cannot be predicted, and that’s the reason it is almost impossible to predict stock prices accurately. Many researchers have already worked in this area. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic had a great effect on the stock market. The main purpose of this paper is to predict the stock closing prices for two major stock exchanges in Bangladesh and compare the prediction accuracy based on before and after pandemic data. The implemented models are Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) and Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Raw datasets were considered, which were collected from Dhaka Stock Exchange(DSE) and Chittagong Stock Exchange(CSE). Data preprocessing was done on both of the datasets. After analyzing the overall accuracy for each algorithm, it was found that LSTM provided better accuracy than ARIMA and SVM for both the DSE and CSE datasets.},

This article takes on this challenge and proposes a 3D Convolutional Neural Network based approach to classify the directional trends in a stock's price. To do that, five companies from a sector are grouped together, and the overall trend in each is predicted simultaneously. This is done to analyze the influence of one company on another. For each company, multiple technical indicators are chosen, and the stock prices are converted into a 3D image of size 15×15×5. To find the best features, we experiment with hierarchical clustering. To complement the 3D Convolutional Neural Network, we also examine the idea of ensemble learning. The proposed method and several existing models are combined to improve the performance of the system. Experimentation is performed on forty-five different companies of the National Stock Exchange. Compared to other similar techniques in literature, our work has achieved up to 35% annual returns for some stocks, with the average being 9.19%. Lastly, we also try to show that grouping companies together and making the prediction on a sector could serve as a new benchmark for stock trend classification.},

   abstract = {<p>Outcome prediction for individual patient groups is of paramount importance in terms of selection of appropriate therapeutic options, risk communication to patients and families, and allocating resource through optimum triage. This has become even more necessary in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Widening the spectrum of predictor variables by including radiological parameters alongside the usually utilized demographic, clinical and biochemical ones can facilitate building a comprehensive prediction model. Automation has the potential to build such models with applications to time-critical environments so that a clinician will be able to utilize the model outcomes in real-time decision making at bedside. We show that amalgamation of computed tomogram (CT) data with clinical parameters (CP) in generating a Machine Learning model from 302 COVID-19 patients presenting to an acute care hospital in India could prognosticate the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Models developed from CP alone, CP and radiologist derived CT severity score and CP with automated lesion-to-lung ratio had AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.85–0.88), 0.89 (95% CI 0.87–0.91), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.89–0.93), respectively. We show that an operating point on the ROC can be chosen to aid clinicians in risk characterization according to the resource availability and ethical considerations. This approach can be deployed in more general settings, with appropriate calibrations, to predict outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients effectively.</p>},

Two of the main problems that society is being confronted with more and more, in this respect, are the inter-related aspects of feelings of loneliness and social isolation among older adults. In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and its associated restrictions have exacerbated the loneliness and social-isolation problems. This paper is first and foremost a comprehensive survey of loneliness monitoring and management solutions, from the multidisciplinary perspective of technology, gerontology, socio-psychology, and urban built environment. In addition, our paper also investigates machine learning-based technological solutions with wearable-sensor data, suitable to measure, monitor, manage, and/or diminish the levels of loneliness and social isolation, when one also considers the constraints and characteristics coming from social science, gerontology, and architecture/urban built environments points of view. Compared to the existing state of the art, our work is unique from the cross-disciplinary point of view, because our authors’ team combines the expertise from four distinct domains, i.e., gerontology, social psychology, architecture, and wireless technology in addressing the two inter-related problems of loneliness and social isolation in older adults. This work combines a cross-disciplinary survey of the literature in the four aforementioned domains with a proposed wearable-based technological solution, introduced first as a generic framework and, then, exemplified through a simple proof of concept with dummy data. As the main findings, we provide a comprehensive view on challenges and solutions in utilizing various technologies, particularly those carried by users, also known as wearables, to measure, manage, and/or diminish the social isolation and the perceived loneliness among older adults. In addition, we also summarize the identified solutions which can be used for measuring and monitoring various loneliness- and social isolation-related metrics, and we present and validate, through a simple proof-of-concept mechanism, an approach based on machine learning for predicting and estimating loneliness levels. Open research issues in this field are also discussed.},

Gate-holding strategies are one of several operational strategies to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint. They have been shown to reduce fuel consumption, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, but past studies have concentrated on taxi times and fuel consumption of outbound aircraft without considering the potential disruptions on inbound traffic, which may be blocked from reaching their intended gates. We verified that reductions in outbound taxi times could be achieved without delaying the times when planes lifted off for departure but, depending on the gate-hold rules employed and the intensity of flight operations, more delays and gate changes occurred for arriving aircraft.

   abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to rapidly mutate and change in ways that impact virulence, transmissibility, and immune evasion. Genome sequencing is a critical tool, as other biological techniques can be more costly, time-consuming, and difficult. However, the rapid and complex evolution of SARS-CoV-2 challenges conventional sequence analysis methods like phylogenetic analysis. The virus picks up and loses mutations independently in multiple subclades, often in novel or unexpected combinations, and, as for the newly emerged Omicron variant, sometimes with long explained branches. We propose interpretable deep sequence models trained by machine learning to complement conventional methods. We apply Transformer-based neural network models developed for natural language processing to analyze protein sequences. We add network layers to generate sample embeddings and sequence-wide attention to interpret models and visualize multiscale patterns. We demonstrate and validate our framework by modeling SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus taxonomy. We then develop an interpretable predictive model of disease severity that integrates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence and patient demographic variables, using publicly available data from the GISAID database. We also apply our model to Omicron. Based on knowledge prior to the availability of empirical data for Omicron, we predict: 1) reduced neutralization antibody activity (15-50 fold) greater than any previously characterized variant, varying between Omicron sublineages, and 2) reduced risk of severe disease (by 35-40%) relative to Delta. Both predictions are in accord with recent epidemiological and experimental data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementGR received National Science Foundation (NSF: https://www.nsf.gov/) grants #1919691 and #2107108.

Several methods have been developed to analyze such data, aiming to improve pharmacovigilance and drug safety. In this work, we provide a brief review of key directions to quantitatively analyzing adverse events and explore the potential of augmenting these methods using additional molecular data descriptors. We argue that molecular expansion of adverse event data may provide a path to improving the insights gained through more traditional pharmacovigilance approaches. Examples include the ability to assess statistical relevance with respect to underlying biomolecular mechanisms, the ability to generate plausible causative hypotheses and/or confirmation where possible, the ability to computationally study potential clinical trial designs and/or results, as well as the further provision of advanced features incorporated in innovative methods, such as machine learning. In summary, molecular data expansion provides an elegant way to extend mechanistic modeling, systems pharmacology, and patient-centered approaches for the assessment of drug safety. We anticipate that such advances in real-world data informatics and outcome analytics will help to better inform public health, via the improved ability to prospectively understand and predict various types of drug-induced molecular perturbations and adverse events.},

Current methods do not consider the context of use when assessing users’ ISA, and therefore they cannot accurately reflect users’ actual behavior, which often depends on that context. In this study, we propose a novel context-based, data-driven, approach for assessing the ISA of users. In this approach, different behavioral and contextual factors, such as spatio-temporal information and browsing habits, are used to assess users’ ISA. Since defining each context explicitly is impractical for a large context space, we utilize a deep neural network to represent users’ contexts implicitly from contextual factors. We evaluate our approach empirically using a real-world dataset of users’ activities collected from 120 smartphone users. The results show that the proposed method and context information improve ISA assessment accuracy significantly.},

   abstract = {Objectives The four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC; Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) identified by May 2021 are highly transmissible, yet little is known about their impact on public health measures. We aimed to synthesise evidence related to public health measures and VOC. Design A rapid scoping review. Data sources On 11 May 2021, seven databases (MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Central Register of Controlled Trials, Epistemonikos' L-OVE on COVID-19, medRxiv, bioRxiv) were searched for terms related to VOC, public health measures, transmission and health systems. No limit was placed on date of publication. Eligibility criteria Studies were included if they reported on any of the four VOCs and public health measures, and were available in English. Only studies reporting on data collected after October 2020, when the first VOC was reported, were included. Data extraction and synthesis Titles, abstracts and full-text articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Data extraction was completed by two independent reviewers using a standardised form. Data synthesis and reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Results Of the 37 included studies, the majority assessed the impact of Alpha (n=32) and were conducted in Europe (n=12) or the UK (n=9). Most were modelling studies (n=28) and preprints (n=28). The majority of studies reported on infection control measures (n=17), followed by modifying approaches to vaccines (n=13), physical distancing (n=6) and either mask wearing, testing or hand washing (n=2). Findings suggest an accelerated vaccine rollout is needed to mitigate the spread of VOC. Conclusions The increased severity of VOC requires proactive public health measures to control their spread. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence for continued implementation of public health measures in conjunction with vaccine rollout. With no studies reporting on Delta, there is a need for further research on this and other emerging VOC on public health measures.},

   abstract = {From early 2020, a novel coronavirus disease pneumonia has shown a global "pandemic" trend at an extremely fast speed. Due to the magnitude of its harm, it has become a major global public health event. In the face of dramatic increase in the number of patients with COVID-19, the need for quick diagnosis of suspected cases has become particularly critical. Therefore, this paper constructs a fuzzy classifier, which aims to detect infected subjects by observing and analyzing the CT images of suspected patients. Firstly, a deep learning algorithm is used to extract the low-level features of CT images in the COVID-CT dataset. Subsequently, we analyze the extracted feature information with attribute reduction algorithm to obtain features with high recognition Then, some key features are selected as the input for the fuzzy diagnosis model to the training model. Finally, several images in the dataset are used as the test set to test the trained fuzzy classifier. The obtained accuracy rate is 94.2%, and the F1-score is 93.8%. Experimental results show that, compared with the deep learning diagnosis methods widely used in medical image analysis, the proposed fuzzy model improves the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis, which consequently helps to curb the spread of COVID-19.},

   abstract = {We propose a realistic model for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures, which takes into account the timedelay for recovery or death processes. The dynamic equations for the entire process are derived by adopting a kinetic-type reactions approach. More specifically, the lockdown and the quarantine measures are modelled by some kind of inhibitor reactions where susceptible and infected individuals can be trapped into inactive states. The dynamics for the recovered people is obtained by accounting people who are only traced back to hospitalized infected people. To get the evolution equation we take inspiration from the Michaelis Menten's enzyme-substrate reaction model (the so-called MM reaction) where the enzyme is associated to the available hospital beds, the substrate to the infected people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively. In other words, everything happens as if the hospitals beds act as a catalyzer in the hospital recovery process. Of course, in our case, the reverse MM reaction has no sense in our case and, consequently, the kinetic constant is equal to zero. Finally, the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for people tested positive to COVID-19 is simply modelled by the following kinetic scheme $S+I\Rightarrow 2I$ with $I\Rightarrow R$ or $I\Rightarrow D$, with $S$, $I$, $R$ and $D$ denoting the compartments susceptible, infected, recovered and deceased people, respectively. The resulting kinetic-type equations provide the ODEs, for elementary reaction steps, describing the number of the infected people, the total number of the recovered people previously hospitalized, subject to the lockdown and the quarantine measure and the total number of deaths. The model foresees also the second wave of infection by coronavirus. The tests carried out on real data for Belgium, France and Germany confirmed the correctness of our model.},

Over 23 million positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported till late August 2020. Medical images such as chest X-rays and Computed Tomography scans are becoming one of the main leading clinical diagnosis tools in fighting against COVID-19, underpinned by Artificial Intelligence based techniques, resulting in rapid decision-making in saving lives. This article provides an extensive review of AI-based methods to assist medical practitioners with comprehensive knowledge of the efficient AI-based methods for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. Nearly all the reported methods so far along with their pros and cons as well as recommendations for improvements are discussed, including image acquisition, segmentation, classification, and follow-up diagnosis phases developed between 2019 and 2020. AI and machine learning technologies have boosted the accuracy of Covid-19 diagnosis, and most of the widely used deep learning methods have been implemented and worked well with a small amount of data for COVID-19 diagnosis. This review presents a detailed mythological analysis for the evaluation of AI-based methods used in the process of detecting COVID-19 from medical images. However, due to the quick outbreak of Covid-19, there are not many ground-truth datasets available for the communities. It is necessary to combine clinical experts’ observations and information from images to have a reliable and efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper suggests that future research may focus on multi-modality based models as well as how to select the best model architecture where AI can introduce more intelligence to medical systems to capture the characteristics of diseases by learning from multi-modality data to obtain reliable results for COVID-19 diagnosis for timely treatment .},

However, to date, there is a significant research gap to understand how InsurTechs have been responsible for this transformation. For this purpose, qualitative research has been carried out, through the analysis of 150 InsurTechs, based on grounded theory methodology. This study has a threefold objective. First, to identify what has driven InsurTechs; second, to discover what types of innovations have emerged, and third, to understand the dynamics of InsurTech. Findings have identified five InsurTech driving capabilities that have been instrumental in boosting innovations in the insurance sector. These five capabilities suggest 15 types of innovations that have transformed the insurance sector.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major threat to pediatric patients and older adults. We describe 4′-fluorouridine (4′-FlU, EIDD-2749), a ribonucleoside analog that inhibits RSV, related RNA viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with high selectivity index in cells and human airway epithelia organoids. Polymerase inhibition within in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assays established for RSV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed transcriptional stalling after incorporation. Once-daily oral treatment was highly efficacious at 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) in RSV-infected mice or 20 mg/kg in ferrets infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, initiated 24 or 12 hours after infection, respectively. These properties define 4′-FlU as a broad-spectrum candidate for the treatment of RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and related RNA virus infections. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

However, in such a dynamic and diverse environment, methods are still needed to support public health decision-making. This paper uses the lens of strong structuration theory to investigate networks of COVID-19 symptoms in the Belfast metropolitan area. A self-supervised machine learning method measuring information entropy was applied to the Northern Ireland COVIDCare app. The findings reveal: (1) relevant stratifications of disease symptoms, (2) particularities in health-wealth networks, and (3) the predictive potential of artificial intelligence to extract entangled knowledge from data in COVID-related apps. The proposed method proved to be effective for near real-time in-situ analysis of COVID-19 progression and to focus and complement public health decisions. Our contribution is relevant to an understanding of SARS-COV-2 symptom entanglements in localised environments. It can assist decision-makers in designing both reactive and proactive health measures that should be personalised to the heterogeneous needs of different populations. Moreover, near real-time assessment of pandemic symptoms using digital technologies will be critical to create early warning systems of emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains and predict the need for healthcare resources.},

   abstract = {Background/Purpose: The increased use of hypofractionated radiotherapy changes department activity. While expected to be cost-effective, departments’ fixed costs may impede savings. Understanding radiotherapy's cost-drivers, to what extent these are fixed and consequences of reducing activity can help to inform reimbursement strategies. Material/Methods: We estimate the cost of radiotherapy provision, using time-driven activity-based costing, for five bone metastases treatment strategies, in a large NHS provider. We compare these estimations to reimbursement tariff and assess their breakdown by cost types: fixed (buildings), semi-fixed (staff, linear accelerators) and variable (materials) costs. Sensitivity analyses assess the cost-drivers and impact of reducing departmental activity on the costs of remaining treatments, with varying disinvestment assumptions. Results: The estimated radiotherapy cost for bone metastases ranges from 430.95€ (single fraction) to 4240.76€ (45 Gy in 25#). Provider costs align closely with NHS reimbursement, except for the stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) strategy (tariff exceeding by 15.3%). Semi-fixed staff costs account for 28.1–39.7% and fixed/semi-fixed equipment/space costs 38.5–54.8% of provider costs. Departmental activity is the biggest cost-driver; reduction in activity increasing cost, predominantly in fractionated treatments. Decommissioning linear accelerators ameliorates this, although can only be realised at equipment capacity thresholds. Conclusion: Hypofractionation is less burdensome to patients and long-term offers a cost-efficient mechanism to treat an increasing number of patients within existing capacity. As a large majority of treatment costs are fixed/semi-fixed, disinvestment is complex, within the life expectancy of a linac, imbalances between demand and capacity will result in higher treatment costs. With a per-fraction reimbursement, this may disincentivise delivery of hypofractionated treatments.},

As in our previous work, the model assumes that the time evolution of the observable quantities (number of people still positive to the infection, hospitalized and fatalities cases, healed people, and total number of people that has contracted the infection) depends on average parameters, namely people diffusion coefficient, infection cross-section, and population density. The model provides information on the tight relationship between the variation of the reported infection cases and a well-defined observable physical quantity: the average number of people that lie within the daily displacement area of any single person. With respect to our previous paper, we have extended the analyses to several regions in Italy, characterized by different levels of restrictions and we have correlated them to the diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, the model now includes self-consistent evaluation of the reproduction index, effect of immunization due to vaccination, and potential impact of virus variants on the dynamical evolution of the outbreak. The model fits the epidemic data in Italy, and allows us to strictly relate the time evolution of the number of hospitalized cases and fatalities to the change of people mobility, vaccination rate, and appearance of an initial concentration of people positives for new variants of the virus.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had its first peak in the United States between April and July of 2020, with incidence and prevalence rates of the virus the greatest in the northeastern coast of the country. At the time of study implementation, there were few studies capturing the perspectives of nurses working the frontlines of the pandemic in any setting as research output in the United States focused largely on treating the disease. Objective: The purpose of this study was to capture the perspectives of nurses in the United States working the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave. We were specifically interested in examining the impact of the pandemic on nurses' roles, professional relationships, and the organizational cultures of their employers. Design: We conducted an online qualitative study with a pragmatic design to capture the perspectives of nurses working during the first wave of the United States COVID-19 pandemic. Through social networking recruitment, frontline nurses from across the country were invited to participate. Participants provided long form, text-based responses to four questions designed to capture their experiences. A combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation–a natural language processing technique–along with traditional summative content analysis techniques were used to analyze the data. Setting: The United States during the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave between May and July of 2020. Results: A total of 318 nurses participated from 29 out of 50 states, with 242 fully completing all questions. Findings suggested that the place of work mattered significantly in terms of the frontline working experience. It influenced role changes, risk assumption, interprofessional teamwork experiences, and ultimately, likelihood to leave their jobs or the profession altogether. Organizational culture and its influence on pandemic response implementation was a critical feature of their experiences. Conclusions: Findings suggest that organizational performance during the pandemic may be reflected in nursing workforce retention as the risk for workforce attrition appears high. It was also clear from the reports that nurses appear to have assumed higher occupational risks during the pandemic when compared to other providers. The 2020 data from this study also offered a number of signals about potential threats to the stability and sustainability of the US nursing workforce that are now manifesting. The findings underscore the importance of conducting health workforce research during a crisis in order to discern the signals of future problems or for long-term crisis response. Tweetable abstract: @US nurses report assuming higher risks when delivering care than other healthcare personnel. @Healthcare leaders made the difference for nurses during the pandemic. How many nurses leave their employer in the next year will tell you who was good, who wasn't. @It was all about the team.

   abstract = {Forage availability was crucial for livestock production across the United States. Rangelands occupied vast areas 31 % of land and were the primary source of forage for livestock. However, extreme climatic conditions such as drought affect rangeland forage production and pose a serious threat to the rangeland enterprise. This increases the need to monitor forage in vast rangelands and adapt to other measures such as cultivating or buying forage to balance demand and supply. Despite this need, resources (studies and tools) on rangeland forage monitoring and existing forage production, handling, and economics were scattered and scarce. Therefore, a comprehensive systematic literature review was performed to gather the current understanding of the technology and resources used for monitoring and economics of forage production. Remote sensing technologies were widely used in recent research for their ability to scout vast areas frequently and machine learning (ML) in successfully comprehending complex relationships. Forage production economics was predominantly available for alfalfa forage crop, but other crops and bale collection logistics during production were ignored. Bale collection using conventional tractor carrying 1 and 2 bales/trip (BPT) and automatic bale picker (8–23 BPT) was simulated mathematically and analyzed with open-source R software using realistic equipment turning scenarios. Fuel consumption based on aggregation distance for ABP decreased on average by 72 % and 53 % compared to the tractor with 1 and 2 BPT. A web-based calculator tool was developed using open-source HTML, CSS, and JavaScript software for forage economic analysis including more than 10 varieties of forage crops involving the economics of bale collection (tractor and ABP). Pasture biomass yield prediction was performed with R software using vegetation index (VI) and climate data through ML approaches. Recursive feature selection (RFE) and random forest (RF) model for forage yield emerged as the best methodology based on accuracy. A web-based interactive tool was developed using the Shiny package in R to accommodate "field-specific," pasture-scale inputs for predicting biomass yield. In conclusion, these successful results demonstrate the possibility of using open-source software for simulating logistics, developing models, and building tools for forage monitoring and analyzing the economics of forage production.},

   abstract = {The pandemic of COVID-19 is currently one of the most significant problems being dealt with, all around the world. It mainly affects the lungs of the infected person which can further result in serious threats. So to avoid this life threatening condition, we have used chest radiological images for COVID-19 detection. This infectious disease is communicable and is spreading rapidly throughout the world. Hence, fast and accurate detection of COVID-19 is mandatory, so one can be given proper treatment well before time. In this paper, the proposed work aims to develop a web application, namely CovSADs(Covid-19 Smart A.I. Diagnosis System), using deep learning approach for faster and efficient detection of COVID-19. This web application uses X-ray and CT scan images for the evaluation. Here, we have developed DeepCovX and DeepCovCT models by incorporating Transfer Learning (TL) approach for COVID-19 detection via chest X-ray and CT scan images respectively. Further, we have used GradCam in case of X-ray to make sure our model is looking at relevant information to make decisions and image-segmentation is used in case of CT scan to extract and localize Region-of-interest (ROI) from binary image. Our proposed models show the accuracy of 95.89% and 98.01% for X-ray and CT scan images respectively. We have obtained specificity of 99.57%, sensitivity of 100%, and AUC of 0.998 in case of X-ray and specificity of 98.80%, sensitivity of 97.06%, and AUC of 0.9875 in case of CT scan images. F1-score is obtained as 0.98 for COVID-19 and 0.98 for Non-COVID-19 in case of CT scan images. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate promising results for COVID-19 detection and extraction of infected lung regions. The primary objective of the web application is to assist the radiologists not only for mass screening but also to help in planning treatment process.},

   abstract = {The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created havoc on humanity by causing millions of deaths and adverse physical and mental health effects. To prepare humankind for the fast and efficient detection of the virus and its variants shortly, COVID-19 detection using Artificial Intelligence and Computer-Aided Diagnosis has been the subject of several studies. To detect COVID-19, there are numerous publicly accessible datasets of Chest X-rays that the researchers have combined to solve the problem of inadequate data. The cause for concern here is that in combining two or more datasets, some of the images might be duplicates, so a curated dataset has been used in this study, taken from an author's paper. This dataset consists of 1281 COVID-19, 3270 Normal X-rays, and 1656 viral-pneumonia infected Chest X-ray images. Dataset has been pre-processed and divided carefully to ensure that there are no duplicate images. A comparative study on many traditional pre-trained models was performed, analyzing top-performing models. Fine-tuned InceptionV3, Modified EfficientNet B0&B1 produced an accuracy of 99.78% on binary classification, i.e., covid-19 infected and normal Chest X-ray image. ResNetV2 had a classification accuracy of 97.90% for 3-class classification i.e., covid-19 infected, normal, and pneumonia. Furthermore, a trailblazing custom CNN-based model, CoviXNet, has been proposed consisting of 15 layers that take efficiency into account. The proposed model CoviXNet exhibited a 10-fold accuracy of 99.47% on binary classification and 96.61% on 3-class. CoviXNet has shown phenomenal performance with exceptional accuracy and minimum computational cost. We anticipate that this comparative study, along with the proposed model CoviXNet, can assist medical centers with the efficient real-life detection of Coronavirus.},

   abstract = {Climate change will have considerable impact on the global economy. Estimates of the economic damages due to climate change have focused on the effect of average temperature, but not the effect of other important climate variables. Related research has not explored the sub-annual economic cycles which may be impacted by climate volatility. To address these deficits, we propose a flexible, non-linear framework which includes a wide range of climate variables to estimate changes in GDP and project sub-annual economic cycle adjustments (period, amplitude, trough depth). We find that the inclusion of a more robust set of climate variables improves model performance by over 20%. Importantly, the improved model predicts an increase in GDP rather than a decrease when only temperature is considered. We also find that climate influences the sub-annual economics of all but one province in Canada. Highest stressed were the Prairie and Atlantic regions. Least stressed was the Southeastern region. Our study advances understanding of the nuances in the relationship between climate change and economic output in Canada. It also provides a method that can be applied to related economies globally to target adaptation and resilience management.},

   abstract = {Nanopore sequencing and phylodynamic modeling have been used to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of viral epidemics, but their application to bacterial pathogens has remained challenging. Cost-effective bacterial genome sequencing and variant calling on nanopore platforms would greatly enhance surveillance and outbreak response in communities without access to sequencing infrastructure. Here, we adapt random forest models for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) polishing developed by Sanderson and colleagues (2020. High precision Neisseria gonorrhoeae variant and antimicrobial resistance calling from metagenomic nanopore sequencing. Genome Res. 30(9):1354-1363) to estimate divergence and effective reproduction numbers (Re) of two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks from remote communities in Far North Queensland and Papua New Guinea (PNG; n = 159). Successive barcoded panels of S. aureus isolates (2 × 12 per MinION) sequenced at low coverage (>5× to 10×) provided sufficient data to accurately infer genotypes with high recall when compared with Illumina references. Random forest models achieved high resolution on ST93 outbreak sequence types (>90% accuracy and precision) and enabled phylodynamic inference of epidemiological parameters using birth-death skyline models. Our method reproduced phylogenetic topology, origin of the outbreaks, and indications of epidemic growth (Re > 1). Nextflow pipelines implement SNP polisher training, evaluation, and outbreak alignments, enabling reconstruction of within-lineage transmission dynamics for infection control of bacterial disease outbreaks on portable nanopore platforms. Our study shows that nanopore technology can be used for bacterial outbreak reconstruction at competitive costs, providing opportunities for infection control in hospitals and communities without access to sequencing infrastructure, such as in remote northern Australia and PNG.},

   abstract = {<p>This essay seeks to build on the concept of exterminism developed by E. P. Thompson in his 1980 New Left Review essay ‘Notes on exterminism, the last state of civilization’. Thompson’s polemical focus on weapons systems in his analysis was the product of a particular moment in history; one where the most precipitous threat to human security was the Cold War. The concept of exhaustionism developed in this piece describes the governance ideologies and frameworks found within advanced capitalist state/societal complexes in response to the present ‘organic crisis’ of post-Cold War global capitalism; one accelerated by the 2008 financial crisis and Covid-19 pandemic. The exhaustionism of political leadership within the contemporary world order has contributed to widely held assumptions that the collapse of civilisation and the planet is either occurring or imminent. Moreover, it is also implied that it is too late for a novel or fundamental transformation in governing ideology, global governance and political economy to reverse the current predicament. This exhaustionism in many ways mirrors the absurdity and cynicism of the Cold War military technicians and nuclear regimes described by Thompson’s concept of exterminism, but with notable differences related to the host of actors involved, temporal horizon, and emphasis on class, imperialism and supremacism.</p>},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is currently raging worldwide, with more patients being diagnosed every day. It usually is diagnosed by examining pathological photographs of the patient's lungs. There is a lot of detailed and essential information on chest radiographs, but manual processing is not as efficient or accurate. As a result, how efficiently analyzing and processing chest radiography of COVID-19 patients is an important research direction to promote COVID-19 diagnosis. To improve the processing efficiency of COVID-19 chest films, a multilevel thresholding image segmentation (MTIS) method based on an enhanced multiverse optimizer (CCMVO) is proposed. CCMVO is improved from the original Multi-Verse Optimizer by introducing horizontal and vertical search mechanisms. It has a more assertive global search ability and can jump out of the local optimum in optimization. The CCMVO-based MTIS method can obtain higher quality segmentation results than HHO, SCA, and other forms and is less prone to stagnation during the segmentation process. To verify the performance of the proposed CCMVO algorithm, CCMVO is first compared with DE, MVO, and other algorithms by 30 benchmark functions; then, the proposed CCMVO is applied to image segmentation of COVID-19 chest radiography; finally, this paper verifies that the combination of MTIS and CCMVO is very successful with good segmentation results by using the Feature Similarity Index (FSIM), the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Therefore, this research can provide an effective segmentation method for a medical organization to process COVID-19 chest radiography and then help doctors diagnose coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).},

   abstract = {Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic becomes increased in a drastic way, with the availability of a limited quantity of rapid testing kits. Therefore, automated COVID-19 diagnosis models are essential to identify the existence of disease from radiological images. Earlier studies have focused on the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques using X-ray images on COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper aims to develop a Deep Learning Based MultiModal Fusion technique called DLMMF for COVID-19 diagnosis and classification from Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed DLMMF model operates on three main processes namely Weiner Filtering (WF) based pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. The proposed model incorporates the fusion of deep features using VGG16 and Inception v4 models. Finally, Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) based classifier is applied for identifying and classifying the test CT images into distinct class labels. The experimental validation of the DLMMF model takes place using open-source COVID-CT dataset, which comprises a total of 760 CT images. The experimental outcome defined the superior performance with the maximum sensitivity of 96.53%, specificity of 95.81%, accuracy of 96.81% and F-score of 96.73%.},

   abstract = {Three-way opinion classification (3WOC) models are based on a human perspective of opinion classification and offer human-like decision-making capabilities. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a three-way decision-making framework with multiple features (fuzzy features and semantic features) in simulating human judgement of opinions. This was an quantitative study. A simple prototype of the three-way decision model was run against the Amazon Musical Instrument dataset to evaluate the model. The data used to verify the results were collected from 125 respondents via an online survey. The participants tested the model in context, then immediately filled in the online questionnaire. Results show that the statistical correlation between semantic features and fuzzy feature is low. Therefore, classification coverage and accuracy can be increased when both types of features are used together rather than using one type of feature alone. With the integration of semantic features and fuzzy features, we found that our three-way decision model performs better than a two-way classification model. Furthermore, the 3WOC model is a simulation of human judgements executed when people make decisions. Finally, we offer usability recommendations based on our analysis. A three-way decision-making framework is a better solution to simulate human judgement of opinion classification than a two-way decision model. The research outcomes will help in the development of better opinion classification systems that can support businesses and organisations to make strategic plans to improve their products or services based on customer preference patterns.},

   abstract = {A growing amount of epidemiological data from multiple countries indicate an increased prevalence of obesity, more importantly central obesity, among hospitalized subjects with COVID-19. This suggests that obesity is a major factor contributing to adverse outcome of the disease. As it is a metabolic disorder with dysregulated immune and endocrine function, it is logical that dysfunctional metabolism contributes to the mechanisms behind obesity being a risk factor for adverse outcome in COVID-19. Emerging data suggest that in obese subjects, (a) the molecular mechanisms of viral entry and spread mediated through ACE2 receptor, a multifunctional host cell protein which links to cellular homeostasis mechanisms, are affected. This includes perturbation of the physiological renin-angiotensin system pathway causing pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic challenges (b) existent metabolic overload and ER stress-induced UPR pathway make obese subjects vulnerable to severe COVID-19, (c) host cell response is altered involving reprogramming of metabolism and epigenetic mechanisms involving microRNAs in line with changes in obesity, and (d) adiposopathy with altered endocrine, adipokine, and cytokine profile contributes to altered immune cell metabolism, systemic inflammation, and vascular endothelial dysfunction, exacerbating COVID-19 pathology. In this review, we have examined the available literature on the underlying mechanisms contributing to obesity being a risk for adverse outcome in COVID-19.},

   abstract = {In training distributed machine learning, communicating model updates among workers has always been a bottleneck. The magnitude of impact on the quality of resultant models is higher when distributed training on low hardware specification devices and in uncertain real-world IoT networks where congestion, latency, bandwidth issues are common. In this scenario, gradient quantization plus encoding is an effective way to reduce cost when communicating model updates. Other approaches can be to limit the client-server communication frequency, adaptive compression by varying the spacing between quantization levels, reusing outdated gradients, deep compression to reduce transmission packet size, and adaptive tuning of the number of bits transmitted per round. The optimization levels provided by such and other non-comprehensive approaches do not suffice for high-dimensional NN models with large size model updates.This paper presents ElastiQuant, an elastic quantization strategy that aims to reduce the impact caused by limitations in distributed IoT training scenarios. The distinguishable highlights of this comprehensive work are: (i) theoretical assurances and bounds on variance and number of communication bits are provided, (ii) worst-case variance analysis is performed, and (iii) momentum is considered in convergence assurance. ElastiQuant experimental evaluation and comparison with top schemes by distributed training 5 ResNets on 18 edge GPUs over ImageNet and CIFAR datasets show: improved solution quality in terms of ≈ 2–11 % training loss reduction, ≈ 1–4 % accuracy boost, and ≈ 4–22 % variance drop; positive scalability due to higher communication compression resulting in saving bandwidth and ≈ 4–30 min per epoch training speedups.},

   abstract = {Cloud-based fog computing was developed in recent years to make it easier for patients to monitor distant health and discover mosquito-borne syndromes at an initial period, allowing to track the mosquito-borne illnesses. Many obstacles have been confronted by the technology, including high latency, mobility, overhead connectivity, and location consciousness. Due to the security issue and wrong prediction of the diseases, users are affected by getting wrong alert messages from fog which increase the disease spreading. Hence a novel Prevention Technique based on Fog Computing has been introduced to prevent the epidemic syndrome at an initial period and safeguard the people around the world. Initially, each user register their personal information in Pristine Database through IoT device. These information are encrypted with 16 round of key-dependent operation via new Blowfish Encryption Algorithm. Subsequently, the mosquito spawned disease is diagnosed by measuring the resemblance factor between the user and disease through the Hybrid Endemic Halsen Classifier and the Resemblance Coefficient are used to diagnose and categorize users as infected or unaffected. The mosquito-borne disease is detected using this method by assessing the similarity factor between the user and the disease with less computing time. As a result, if a new symptom is found rather than one from the given medical dataset, the information will be saved in the Pristine Database, and the classification process will be faster with less computing time in the future if the same symptom is identified. Finally, the novel Temporal Social Network Analysis was developed to assess the likelihood of a disease breakout also analyze the infected users and send the awareness message to take the precautionary measures in the cloud processing layer. Thus, the proposed work effectively predicts and prevents the spreading of epidemic outbreaks with accuracy of 97% which is 7.2% higher than the existing approaches, and reduced latency of 0.18 second.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A participant's medical history is important in clinical research and can be captured from electronic health records (EHRs) and self-reported surveys. Both can be incomplete, EHR due to documentation gaps or lack of interoperability and surveys due to recall bias or limited health literacy. This analysis compares medical history collected in the All of Us Research Program through both surveys and EHRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The All of Us medical history survey includes self-report questionnaire that asks about diagnoses to over 150 medical conditions organized into 12 disease categories. In each category, we identified the 3 most and least frequent self-reported diagnoses and retrieved their analogues from EHRs. We calculated agreement scores and extracted participant demographic characteristics for each comparison set. RESULTS: The 4th All of Us dataset release includes data from 314 994 participants; 28.3% of whom completed medical history surveys, and 65.5% of whom had EHR data. Hearing and vision category within the survey had the highest number of responses, but the second lowest positive agreement with the EHR (0.21). The Infectious disease category had the lowest positive agreement (0.12). Cancer conditions had the highest positive agreement (0.45) between the 2 data sources. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study quantified the agreement of medical history between 2 sources-EHRs and self-reported surveys. Conditions that are usually undocumented in EHRs had low agreement scores, demonstrating that survey data can supplement EHR data. Disagreement between EHR and survey can help identify possible missing records and guide researchers to adjust for biases.},

The integrated features provided a low-dimensional significant feature area for better facial data representation. Feasible Weighted Squirrel Search Optimization (FW-SSO) algorithm is applied for selecting the optimal features due to its efficient exploration of the search space and enhancement of the dynamic search. The output of the FW-SSO algorithm is used for tuning the autoencoder. Autoencoder is used for combining the G&A features, for feature optimization process. Classification is done by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with Attention Mechanism (ALSTM), as it is highly efficient in capturing the long-term dependency of the facial landmarks in the image/video sequences. The proposed fused deep learning method focuses on the fusion of the G&A features for high discrimination. Experimental analysis using FER-2013 and LIRIS datasets demonstrated that the proposed method achieved maximum accuracy of 85.96% than the existing architectures and maximum accuracy of 88.24% than the VGGNet-CNN architecture.},

   abstract = {In the midst of an outbreak, identification of groups of individuals that represent risk for transmission of the pathogen under investigation is critical to public health efforts. Several approaches exist that utilize the evolutionary information from pathogen genomic data derived from infected individuals to distinguish these groups from the background population, comprised of primarily randomly sampled individuals with undetermined epidemiological linkage. These methods are, however, limited in their ability to characterize the dynamics of these groups, or clusters of transmission. Dynamic transmission patterns within these clusters, whether it be the result of changes at the level of the virus (e.g., infectivity) or host (e.g., vaccination implementation), are critical in strategizing public health interventions, particularly when resources are limited. Phylogenetic trees are widely used not only in the detection of transmission clusters, but the topological shape of the branches within can be useful sources of information regarding the dynamics of the represented population. We evaluate the limitation of existing tree shape statistics when dealing with smaller sub-trees containing transmission clusters and offer instead a phylogeny-based deep learning system DeepDynaTree for classification of transmission cluster. Comprehensive experiments carried out on a variety of simulated epidemic growth models indicate that this graph deep learning approach is effective in predicting cluster dynamics (balanced accuracy of 0.826 vs. 0.533 and Brier score of 0.234 vs. 0.466 in independent test set). Our deployment model in DeepDynaTree incorporates a primal-dual graph neural network principle using output from phylogenetic-based cluster identification tools (available from https://github.com/salemilab/DeepDynaTree).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

One of the most important factors for companies to not only survive but also thrive in today’s competitive market is their logistics performance. This paper aims, through a systematic literature analysis of 115 papers from 2012 to 2020, at presenting quantitative insights and comprehensive overviews of the current and future research landscapes of sustainable logistics in the Industry 4.0 era. The results show that Industry 4.0 technologies provide opportunities for improving the economic efficiency, environmental performance, and social impact of logistics sectors. However, several challenges arise with this technological transformation, i.e., trade-offs among different sustainability indicators, unclear benefits, lifecycle environmental impact, inequity issues, and technology maturity. Thus, to better tackle the current research gaps, future suggestions are given to focus on the balance among different sustainability indicators through the entire lifecycle, human-centric technological transformation, system integration and digital twin, semi-autonomous transportation solutions, smart reverse logistics, and so forth.},

   abstract = {Natural language generation&nbsp;(NLG) has been an essential technique for various applications, like XiaoIce and Siri, and engaged increasing attention recently. To improve the user experience, several emotion-aware NLG methods have been developed to generate responses coherent with a pre-designated emotion (e.g., the positive or negative). Nevertheless, existing methods cannot generate personalized responses as they frequently overlook the personalized linguistic style. Apparently, different human responsers tend to have different linguistic styles. Inspired by this, in this work, we focus on a novel research theme of personalized emotion-aware NLG (PENLG), whereby the generated responses should be coherent with the linguistic style of a pre-designated responser and emotion. In particular, we study PENLG under a scenario of generating personalized emotion-aware response for social media post. Yet it faces certain research challenges: (1) the user linguistic styles are implicit and complex by nature, and hence it is hard to learn their representations; and (2) linguistic styles and emotions are usually expressed in different manners in a response, and thus how to convey them properly in the generated responses is not easy. Toward this end, we present a novel scheme of PENLG, named CRobot, which consists of a personalized emotion-aware response generator and two discriminators, i.e., general discriminator and personalized emotion-aware discriminator. To be more specific, the post-based and avatar-based user linguistic style modeling methods are incorporated into the encoder-decoder–based generator, while the discriminators are devised to ensure that the generated response is fluent and consistent with both the emotion and the linguistic style of the user. Different from the traditional adversarial networks, we embed adversarial learning under the umbrella of reinforcement learning. In this way, the response generation problem can be tackled by the generator taking a sequence of actions on selecting the proper word of each timestep for output. To justify our model, we construct a large-scale response generation dataset based on Twitter, consisting of 6,763 tweets with a corresponding 1,461,713 response created by 153,664 users. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRobot surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines regarding both subjective and objective evaluation.},

Understanding how CPS skills affect CPS performance outcomes can inform CPS training, task design, feedback design, and automated assessment. We investigated CPS behaviors (individually and in co-occurring patterns) in 101 (N = 303) remote triads who collaboratively played an educational game called Physics Playground for 45-min. Team interactions consisted of open-ended speech occurring over videoconferencing with screen sharing. We coded participant's utterances relative to a CPS framework consisting of three facets (i.e., competencies such as constructing shared knowledge) manifested in 19 specific indicators (e.g., responds to others' questions/ideas). A matching technique was used to isolate the effect of CPS behaviors on CPS outcomes (quality of solution of a game level) controlling for pertinent covariates. Mixed-effects ordinal regression models indicated that proposing solution ideas and discussing results were the major predictors of CPS performance, and that team-member activities surrounding idea generation mattered. These findings highlighted the importance of both individual and collective contributions and social and cognitive skills in successful CPS outcomes.},

Next, the data pre-processing and exploratory investigation are accomplished for better understanding of the collected data. Further, the feature extraction is performed using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), GloVe, pre-trained Word2Vec, and fast text embedding's. The obtained feature vectors are fed to the ensemble classifier (Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Capsule Neural Network (CapsNet)) for classifying the user's sentiment's as anger, sad, joy, and fear.

Results and severity of samples based on quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), cycle threshold, and patient lymphocyte numbers were clinically labeled. Our suggested general methods consist of a tensor based on audio characteristics and deep-artificial neural network classification with deep cough convolutional layers, based on the dilated temporal convolution neural network (DTCN). DTCN has approximately 76% accuracy, 73.12% in TCN, and 72.11% in CNN-LSTM which have been trained at a learning rate of 0.2%, respectively. In our scenario, CNN-LSTM can no longer be employed for COVID-19 predictions, as they would generally offer questionable forecasts. In the previous stage, we discussed the exactness of the total cases of TCN, dilated TCN, and CNN-LSTM models which were truly predicted. Our proposed technique to identify COVID-19 can be considered as a robust and in-demand technique to rapidly detect the infection. We believe it can considerably hinder the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.},

   abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterised by a progressive loss of central vision. Intermediate AMD is a risk factor for progression to advanced stages categorised as geographic atrophy (GA) and neovascular AMD. However, rates of progression to advanced stages vary between individuals. Recent advances in imaging and computing technologies have enabled deep phenotyping of intermediate AMD. The aim of this project is to utilise machine learning (ML) and advanced statistical modelling as an innovative approach to discover novel features and accurately quantify markers of pathological retinal ageing that can individualise progression to advanced AMD. The PINNACLE study consists of both retrospective and prospective parts. In the retrospective part, more than 400,000 optical coherent tomography (OCT) images collected from four University Teaching Hospitals and the UK Biobank Population Study are being pooled, centrally stored and pre-processed. With this large dataset featuring eyes with AMD at various stages and healthy controls, we aim to identify imaging biomarkers for disease progression for intermediate AMD via supervised and unsupervised ML. The prospective study part will firstly characterise the progression of intermediate AMD in patients followed between one and three years; secondly, it will validate the utility of biomarkers identified in the retrospective cohort as predictors of progression towards late AMD. Patients aged 55–90 years old with intermediate AMD in at least one eye will be recruited across multiple sites in UK, Austria and Switzerland for visual function tests, multimodal retinal imaging and genotyping. Imaging will be repeated every four months to identify early focal signs of deterioration on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) by human graders. A focal event triggers more frequent follow-up with visual function and imaging tests. The primary outcome is the sensitivity and specificity of the OCT imaging biomarkers. Secondary outcomes include sensitivity and specificity of novel multimodal imaging characteristics at predicting disease progression, ROC curves, time from development of imaging change to development of these endpoints, structure-function correlations, structure-genotype correlation and predictive risk models. This is one of the first studies in intermediate AMD to combine both ML, retrospective and prospective AMD patient data with the goal of identifying biomarkers of progression and to report the natural history of progression of intermediate AMD with multimodal retinal imaging.},

   abstract = {As the COVID-19 continues to disrupt the global norms, there is the requirement of modeling frameworks to accurately assess and quantify the impact of the pandemic on the electricity sector and its emissions. In this study, we devise machine learning models to estimate the pandemic induced reduction in electricity consumption based on weather, econometrics, and social-distancing parameters for seven major Indian states. As per our baseline electricity consumption model, we find that the electricity consumption dropped by 15–33% in 2020 (March-May) during the complete lockdown phase, followed by 6–13% (June-August) during the unlock phases and gradually reached the norms by September 2020. As a result, the net CO2 emissions from power generation in 2020 dropped by 7% and 5% compared to 2018 and 2019 respectively. Amidst the ongoing second wave since mid-April 2021, we projected the electricity consumption across states from May-August by accounting for two scenarios. Under the reference and worst-case scenarios, the electricity consumption approximates 106% and 96% of the non-pandemic situation, respectively. The modeling framework developed in this study is purely data-orientated, cross-deployable across spatio-temporal scales and can serve as a valuable tool to inform current and future energy policies amidst and post COVID-19.},

The present integrated bioinformatics–cheminformatics approach was employed to locate potent antiviral marine alkaloids that could be used against SARS-CoV-2. Initially, 57 antiviral marine alkaloids and two repurposing drugs were selected from an extensive literature review. Then, the putative target enzyme SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2-Mpro) was retrieved from the protein data bank and carried out a virtual screening-cum-molecular docking study with all candidates using PyRx 0.8 and AutoDock 4.2 software. Further, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the two most potential alkaloids and a drug docking complex at 100 ns (with two ligand topology files from PRODRG and ATB server, separately), the molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) free energy, and contributions of entropy were investigated. Then, the physicochemical-toxicity-pharmacokinetics-drug-likeness profiles, the frontier molecular orbitals energies (highest occupied molecular orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and ΔE), and structural–activity relationship were assessed and analyzed. Based on binding energy, 8-hydroxymanzamine (−10.5 kcal/mol) and manzamine A (−10.1 kcal/mol) from all alkaloids with darunavir (−7.9 kcal/mol) and lopinavir (−7.4 kcal/mol) against SARS-CoV-2-Mpro were recorded. The MD simulation (RMSD, RMSF, Rg, H-bond, MM/PBSA binding energy) illustrated that the 8-hydroxymanzamine exhibits a static thermodynamic feature than the other two complexes. The predicted physicochemical, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and drug-likeness profiles also revealed that the 8-hydroxymanzamine could be used as a potential lead candidate individually and/or synergistically with darunavir or lopinavir to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection after some pharmacological validation.},

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and at multiple steps in the viral life cycle. In SC2-VLPs, four nucleocapsid (N) mutations found universally in more-transmissible variants independently increased messenger RNA delivery and expression ~10-fold, and in a reverse genetics model, the serine-202→arginine (S202R) and arginine-203→methionine (R203M) mutations each produced >50 times as much virus. SC2-VLPs provide a platform for rapid testing of viral variants outside of a biosafety level 3 setting and demonstrate N mutations and particle assembly to be mechanisms that could explain the increased spread of variants, including B.1.617.2 (Delta, which contains the R203M mutation).

It concludes that digital technologies impinge on some defining features of occupations, such as workload and intensity of work; the degree to which the tasks can be explicitly defined, measured and codified; composition and amount of skills required for task execution; and the importance of experience or tacit knowledge for task execution. Non-technological factors, such as managerial approach to technology and work design moderate outcomes. Evidence indicates that a reduction in the routine content of job tasks applies only to relatively skilled employees. For low-skilled employees, certain digital assistance solutions increase routine and engender deskilling. We conclude that a qualitative enrichment of shopfloor work becomes apparent only if (1) employees are skilled enough to become upskilled – and thus engaged not only in digitally enabled but also in digitally augmented, high-value activities; (2) employees’ work tasks are reorganised, work design and work practices modified, and employees upskilled. Without appropriate managerial interventions envisaging the augmentation of work, digital technology implementation entails deskilling and/or technological unemployment, rather than providing richer dimensions to shopfloor work.},

   abstract = {Background: The burden of bloodstream infections remains high worldwide and cannot be confined to short-term in-hospital mortality. We aimed to develop scores to predict short-term and long-term mortality in patients with bloodstream infections. Methods: The Bloodstream Infection due to Multidrug-resistant Organisms: Multicenter Study on Risk Factors and Clinical Outcomes (BLOOMY) study is a prospective, multicentre cohort study at six German tertiary care university hospitals to develop and validate two scores assessing 14-day and 6-month mortality in patients with bloodstream infections. We excluded patients younger than 18 years or who were admitted to an ophthalmology or psychiatry ward. Microbiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and survival data were prospectively collected on day 0 and day 3 and then from day 7 onwards, weekly. Participants were followed up for 6 months. All patients in the derivation cohort who were alive on day 3 were included in the analysis. Predictive scores were developed using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models with a machine-learning approach. Validation was completed using the C statistic and predictive accuracy was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Findings: Between Feb 1, 2017, and Jan 31, 2019, 2568 (61·5%) of 4179 eligible patients were recruited into the derivation cohort. The in-hospital mortality rate was 23·75% (95% CI 22·15–25·44; 610 of 2568 patients) and the 6-month mortality rate was 41·55% (39·54–43·59; 949 of 2284). The model predictors for 14-day mortality (C statistic 0·873, 95% CI 0·849–0·896) and 6-month mortality (0·807, 0·784–0·831) included age, body-mass index, platelet and leukocyte counts, C-reactive protein concentrations, malignancy (ie, comorbidity), in-hospital acquisition, and pathogen. Additional predictors were, for 14-day mortality, mental status, hypotension, and the need for mechanical ventilation on day 3 and, for 6-month mortality, focus of infection, in-hospital complications, and glomerular filtration rate at the end of treatment. The scores were validated in a cohort of 1023 patients with bloodstream infections, recruited between Oct 9, 2019, and Dec 31, 2020. The BLOOMY 14-day score showed a sensitivity of 61·32% (95% CI 51·81–70·04), a specificity of 86·36% (83·80–88·58), a positive predictive value (PPV) of 37·57% (30·70–44·99), and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94·35% (92·42–95·80). The BLOOMY 6-month score showed a sensitivity of 69·93% (61·97–76·84), a specificity of 66·44% (61·86–70·73), a PPV of 40·82% (34·85–47·07), and a NPV of 86·97% (82·91–90·18). Interpretation: The BLOOMY scores showed good discrimination and predictive values and could support the development of protocols to manage bloodstream infections and also help to estimate the short-term and long-term burdens of bloodstream infections.

   abstract = {This paper proposes a novel integrated framework for nesting (i.e., part orientation selection and two-dimensional packing) and scheduling parts assigned to batches (or jobs) on additive manufacturing machines. For the first time, a tri-objective optimization model is designed that interprets profit, energy utilization of machines, and goodwill losses (i.e., tardiness, negotiation, and increasing due date) as three sustainability criteria. Besides, considered negotiation plans may reduce the prices of ordered parts for a possible increase in the initial due date set by customers. The model's scalability is supported by tailoring three algorithms: robust improved ɛ-constraint method, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), and multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO). Several insights are derived by analyzing the model's sensitivity to its key parameters and validating its applicability by a case study of Amazon's last-mile delivery process. The results confirm the conflicting objectives, suggested action plans, and proposed algorithms.},

   abstract = {Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, Taiwan had gone through three local outbreaks. Unlike the first two, the spatial and temporal origin of the third outbreak (April 20 to November 5, 2021) is still unclear. We sequenced and reconstructed the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and find that the third outbreak was caused by a single virus lineage (T-III), which carries four genetic fingerprints, including spike M1237I (S-M1237I), and three silent changes. The T-III is closest to sequences derived from Turkey on February 8, 2021. The estimated date of divergence from the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of T-III is March 23, 2021 (95% HPD February 24 - April 13, 2021), almost one month before the first three confirmed cases on April 20, 2021. The effective population size of the T-III showed approximately 20-fold increase after the onset of the outbreak and reached a plateau in early June. Consequently, the lineage leading to the third outbreak most likely originated from Europe, perhaps Turkey, in February 2021. In addition, the T-III could have circulated in Taiwan in mid-March 2021. The virus was unnoticed while spreading within the community.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the need to partner with the community in pandemic preparedness and response in order to enable trust-building among stakeholders, which is key in pandemic management. Citizen science, defined here as a practice of public participation and collaboration in all aspects of scientific research to increase knowledge and build trust with governments and researchers, is a crucial approach to promoting community engagement. By harnessing the potential of digitally enabled citizen science, one could translate data into accessible, comprehensible and actionable outputs at the population level. The application of citizen science in health has grown over the years, but most of these approaches remain at the level of participatory data collection. This narrative review examines citizen science approaches in participatory data generation, modelling and visualisation, and calls for truly participatory and co-creation approaches across all domains of pandemic preparedness and response. Further research is needed to identify approaches that optimally generate short-term and long-term value for communities participating in population health. Feasible, sustainable and contextualised citizen science approaches that meaningfully engage affected communities for the long-term will need to be inclusive of all populations and their cultures, comprehensive of all domains, digitally enabled and viewed as a key component to allow trust-building among the stakeholders. The impact of COVID-19 on people’s lives has created an opportune time to advance people’s agency in science, particularly in pandemic preparedness and response.</p>},

   abstract = {As most governments in the world currently face the pandemic, various policies and initiatives have been put in place in order to help control the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. While these initiatives and interventions are taking place, a pandemic still creates a reality of risk and uncertainty. In these kinds of situations, public trust is greatly important to properly mitigate health and societal impacts of the pandemic. Social media platforms could be utilized as sources of information to gain insight on public sentiment, especially with the rise of social media utilization during the quarantine [13]. Given this, the study attempts to analyze social media sentiments particularly found in Twitter in order to not only look into the polarity of public sentiment on the government, its processes, and its policies, but particularly, to detect trust between the governed and the ones governing. Furthermore, it seeks to examine and analyze the trust narratives present in the Philippines currently. In this study, a supervised machine learning model was created using Linear SVC, utilizing TF-IDF and n-grams for feature extraction and selection in order to detect the respective trust category of a given sentiment and predict the trust category of new data points. While the results are overall negative, examining the trust categories individually demonstrates different narratives that dictate, affect, and express citizen trust towards different aspects of the government. The behavioral trust group provided narratives on certain political figures involved in a string of anomalies for the negative category, while the positive category lauded the VP for her continued service amidst the pandemic. On the other hand, narratives in the institutional trust group revolved around national and local institutions, where talks about national institutions being more prominent in the negative category, while local institutions, such as local government units, are found in the positive category. Lastly, narratives on the operational trust group focused on certain pandemic policies (lockdowns, mass testing, contact tracing) for the negative side, while vaccines and vaccinations were the focus for the positive side.},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect a wide range of mammals. Since its spread in humans, secondary host jumps of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to a variety of domestic and wild populations of mammals have been documented. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in different host species is of fundamental interest while also providing indication of how SARS-CoV-2 may have adapted to human hosts soon after the initial host jump, a time window for which there are no genome sequences available. Moreover, the study of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in animals is critical to assess the risk that the transmission of animal-adapted viral lineages back into humans (i.e., spillback) may pose. Here, we compared the genomic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from animal species relative to that in humans, profiling the mutational biases indicative of potentially different selective pressures in animals. We focused on viral genomes collected in infected mink (Neovison vison) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for which reports of multiple independent spillover events and subsequent animal-to-animal transmission are available. We identified six candidate mutations for animal-specific adaptation in mink (NSP9_G37E, Spike_F486L, Spike_N501T, Spike_Y453F, ORF3a_T229I, ORF3a_L219V), and one in deer (NSP3a_L1035F), though these mutations appear to confer minimal advantage for circulation in humans. Additionally, circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in mink and deer has not caused considerable changes to the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 thus far. Finally, our results suggest that minimal adaptation was required for human-to-animal spillover and subsequent onward transmission in mink and deer, highlighting the generalist nature of SARS-CoV-2 as a pathogen of mammalian hosts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Conducting taxonomic classification for metagenomic data is an important means to characterize the viral composition in the underlying samples. However, RNA viruses are abundant and highly diverse, jeopardizing the sensitivity of comparison-based classification methods. To improve the sensitivity of read-level taxonomic classification, we developed an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene-based read classification tool RdRpBin. It combines alignment-based strategy with machine learning models in order to fully exploit the sequence properties of RdRp. We tested our method and compared its performance with the state-of-the-art tools on the simulated and real sequencing data. RdRpBin competes favorably with all. In particular, when the query RNA viruses share low sequence similarity with the known viruses ($~0.4$), our tool can still maintain a higher F-score than the state-of-the-art tools. The experimental results on real data also showed that RdRpBin can classify more RNA viral reads with a relatively low false-positive rate. Thus, RdRpBin can be utilized to classify novel and diverged RNA viruses.},

Buffer sizing, an important factor for network performance, however, has not received enough attention in programmable network. The state-of-the-art buffer sizing solutions usually employ either fixed buffer size or adjust the buffer size heuristically. Without programmability, they suffer from either massive packet drops or large queueing delay in dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Buffer Sizing (ABS), a low-cost and deploy-friendly framework compatible with programmable network. By decoupling the data plane and control plane, ABS-capable switches only need to react to the actions from controller, optimizing network performance in run-time under dynamic traffic. Meanwhile, actions can be programmed by particular Machine Learning (ML) models in the controller to meet different network requirements. In this paper, we address two specific ML models for different scenarios, a reinforcement learning model for relatively stable network with user specific quality requirements, and a supervised learning model for highly dynamic network condition. We implement the ABS framework by integrating the prevalent network simulator NS-2 with ML module. The experiment shows that ABS outperforms state-of-the-art buffer sizing solutions by up to 38.23x under various network environments.},

For this purpose, we took into account national-level climatic, environmental, clinical, health, economic, pollution, social, and demographic factors. We estimated the growth of the first and second wave across countries by fitting a logistic model to daily-reported case numbers, up to the first and second epidemic peaks. We estimated the basic and effective (second wave) reproduction numbers across countries. Next, we used a random forest algorithm to study the association between the growth rate of the second wave and NPIs as well as pre-existing country-specific characteristics. Lastly, we compared the growth rate of the first and second waves of COVID-19. The top three factors associated with the growth of the second wave were body mass index, the number of days that the government sets restrictions on requiring facial coverings outside the home at all times, and restrictions on gatherings of 10 people or less. Artificial intelligence techniques can help scholars as well as decision and policy-makers estimate the effectiveness of public health policies, and implement “smart” interventions, which are as efficacious as stringent ones.},

   abstract = {In 2020 North Italy suffered the SARS-CoV-2-related pandemic with a high number of deaths and hospitalization. The effect of atmospheric parameters on the amount of hospital admissions (temperature, solar radiation, particulate matter, relative humidity and wind speed) is studied through about 8 months (May–December). Two periods are considered depending on different conditions: a) low incidence of COVID-19 and very few regulations concerning personal mobility and protection (“free/summer period”); b) increasing incidence of disease, social restrictions and use of personal protections (“confined/autumn period”). The “hospitalized people in medical area wards/100000 residents” was used as a reliable measure of COVID-19 spreading and load on the sanitary system. We developed a chemometric approach (multiple linear regression analysis) using the daily incidence of hospitalizations as a function of the single independent variables and of their products (interactions). Eight administrative domains were considered (altogether 26 million inhabitants) to account for relatively homogeneous territorial and social conditions. The obtained models very significantly match the daily variation of hospitalizations, during the two periods. Under the confined/autumn period, the effect of non-pharmacologic measures (social distances, personal protection, etc.) possibly attenuates the virus diffusion despite environmental factors. On the contrary, in the free/summer conditions the effects of atmospheric parameters are very significant through all the areas. Particulate matter matches the growth of hospitalizations in areas with low chronic particulate pollution. Fewer hospitalizations strongly correspond to higher temperature and solar radiation. Relative humidity plays the same role, but with a lesser extent. The interaction between solar radiation and high temperature is also highly significant and represents surprising evidence. The solar radiation alone and combined with high temperature exert an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, via both the direct inactivation of virions and the stimulation of vitamin D synthesis, improving immune system function.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 looks to be the worst pandemic disease in the last decades due to its number of infected people, deaths, and the staggering demand for healthcare services, especially hospitals. The first and most important step is to identify the patient flow through a certain process. For the second step, there is a crucial need for predicting the future patient arrivals for planning especially at the administrative level of a hospital. This study aims to first simulate the patient flow process and then predict the future entry of patients in a hospital as the case study. Also, according to the system status, this study suggests some policies based on different probable scenarios and assesses the outcome of each decision to improve the policies. The simulation model is conducted by Arena.15 software. The seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model is used for patient’s arrival prediction within 30 days. Different scenarios are evaluated through a data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. The simulation model runs for predicted patient’s arrival for the least efficient scenario and the outputs compare the base run scenario. Results show that the system collapses after 14 days according to the predictions and simulation and the bottleneck of the ICU and CCU departments becomes problematic. Hospitals can use simulation and also prediction tools to avoid the crisis to plan for the future in the pandemic. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

   abstract = {The exact conditions under which volatility timing strategies yield value are documented. These conditions include: the ability to correctly forecast next period stochastic variance, and violation of a strict version of Merton’s intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM). While the empirical evidence supports the first of these conditions, the latter remains open to debate. Our empirical results confirm the former, but demonstrate a significant violation of the (strict) ICAPM. It follows that volatility timing strategies appear to have value. However, using reasonable parameter values plugged into the derived formulae, the results also show that extreme leverage is often required for success. A method of tempering leverage is proposed, which is somewhat able to loosen the requirement of high leverage while still maintaining a good performance level. Given the likely variation in (strict) ICAPM violations across time and assets, it follows that volatility timing success (or failure) is very much sample dependent.},

   abstract = {One of the main concerns of cybersecurity is the detection of hoaxes across social media. Hoaxers propagate such messages to mislead users and to promote violence. Several approaches exist in literature to address this issue. They are mainly limited to detect hoax activities by characterizing the message nature and detecting provenance of messages. However, unless hoaxes are detected, they continue to propagate across social media nodes. This work aims at reducing the dissemination of hoaxes across group of users. Relying on social graph structure, this research develops a mechanism based on smart contract logics to prevent a group to consume a fake post. To achieve this objective, we used a smart contract to exploit a trust index computed based on message characteristics and group features such as graph density, group status, group degree, group acceptability. Based on the value of trust index, the message is forwarded or blocked. Experiments realized on groups of different characteristics revealed that the proposed smart contract is even able to reactively block a fake post of the same nature than the group type. Results indicate that the proportion of targeted groups could be reduced even if their interests match with the message subject. This research is an important step forward to anti-promote hoaxes with the novelty of exploiting smart contract approach to contain their propagation.},

   abstract = {Elevated business uncertainties and competition over recent years have caused changes to the data-driven supply chain management of sourcing and inventories across industries. However, only large-sized enterprises have the resources to harness data for aiding their decision-making and planning. By contrast, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) commonly have limited resources and knowledge, which affects their ability to collect and utilize data. Thus, it is a challenge for them to implement advanced decision support tools to mitigate the effects of market uncertainties. This paper proposes a decision support system (DSS) for sourcing and inventory management, with the aims of helping SMEs compile and exploit data, and supporting their decisions under business ambiguities. The DSS was developed using a simulation-optimization approach by incorporating an artificial neural network and a genetic algorithm for problem representation and optimizing decision support solutions. The exploitation of observational and empirical data reduces the burden of data compilation obtained from unorganized data sources across SME operations. Further, uncertainty factors such as raw material demand, price, and supply lead time were considered. When implemented in a medium-sized food industry company, the DSS can provide decision support solutions that integrate the selection of recommended suppliers and optimal order quantities. It can also help decision-makers to shape their inventory management policies under uncertain raw material demands, while also considering service levels, sales promotions, lead times, and material availability from multiple suppliers. Consequently, implementation of the DSS helped to reduce the total purchased raw material costs by an average of 51.62% and reduced the order interval and on-hand inventory costs by an average of 54.24%.},

   abstract = {Background: Overcrowding is a serious problem that impacts the ability to provide optimal level of care in a timely manner. High patient volume is known to increase the boarding time at the emergency department (ED), as well as at post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Furthermore, the same high volume increases inpatient bed transfer times, which causes delays in elective surgeries, increases the probability of near misses, patient safety incidents, and adverse events. Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop a Machine Learning (ML) based strategy to predict weekly forecasts of the inpatient bed demand in order to assist the resource planning for the ED and PACU, resulting in a more efficient utilization. Methods: The data utilized included all adult inpatient encounters at Geisinger Medical Center (GMC) for the last 5 years. The variables considered were class of inpatient encounter, observation, or surgical overnight recovery (SORU) at the time of their discharge. The ML based strategy is built using the K-means clustering method and the Support Vector Machine Regression technique (K-SVR). Results: The performance obtained by the K-SVR strategy in the retrospective cohort amounts to a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) that ranges between 0.49 and 4.10% based on the test period. Additionally, results present a reduced variability, which translates into more stable forecasting results. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate the capacity of ML techniques to forecast inpatient bed demand, particularly using K-SVR. It is expected that the implementation of this model in the workflow of bed capacity management will create efficiencies, which will translate in a more reliable, inexpensive and timely care for patients.},

Current discoveries within machine learning and particularly in deep learning enable qualitative change within the industrial processes, applications, systems and products. However, there is an important challenge related to explainability of (and, therefore, trust to) the decisions made by the deep learning models (aka black-boxes) and their poor capacity for being integrated with each other. Explainable artificial intelligence is needed instead but without loss of effectiveness of the deep learning models. In this paper we present the transformation technique between black-box models and explainable (as well as interoperable) classifiers on the basis of semantic rules via automatic recreation of the training datasets and retraining the decision trees (explainable models) in between. Our transformation technique results to explainable rule-based classifiers with good performance and efficient training process due to embedded incremental ignorance discovery and adversarial samples ("corner cases") generation algorithms. We have also shown the use-case scenario for such explainable and interoperable classifiers, which is collaborative condition monitoring, diagnostics and predictive maintenance of distributed (and isolated) smart industrial assets while preserving data and knowledge privacy of the users.},

Recent events have shown that professionals participating in risk analysis can be held personally liable. It is timely and important to ask: How can risk science guide risk analysis with consideration of those liabilities, particularly in response to emerging and unprecedented risk. This paper studies this topic by: (1) Categorizing how professionals with risk analysis responsibilities have historically been held liable, and (2) developing a framework to address uncertainty related to those potential liabilities. The result of this framework will enable individual analysts and organizations to investigate and manage the expectations of risk analysts and others as they apply risk principles and methods.

These healthcare devices will result in big real-time data streams. Hence, healthcare-based big data analytics and monitoring have gained hawk-eye importance but needs improvisation.

   abstract = {The significant challenges seen with the mathematical modeling and control of spatial parallel manipulators are its difficulty in the kinematic formulation and the inability to real-time control. The analytical approaches for the determination of the kinematic solutions are computationally expensive. This is due to the passive joints, solvability issues with non-linear equations, and inherent kinematic constraints within the manipulator architecture. Therefore, this article concentrates on an artificial neural network–based system identification approach to resolve the complexities of mathematical formulations. Moreover, the low computation time with neural networks adds up to its advantage of real-time control. Besides, this article compares the performance of a constant gain proportional–integral–derivative (PID), variable gain proportional–integral–derivative, model predictive controller, and a cascade controller with combined variable proportional–integral–derivative and model predictive controller for real-time tracking of the end-effector. The control strategies are simulated on the Simulink model of a 6-degree-of-freedom 3-PPSS (P—prismatic; S—spherical) parallel manipulator. The simulation and real-time experiments performed on the fabricated manipulator prototype indicate that the proposed cascade controller with position and velocity compensation is an appropriate method for accurate tracking along the desired path. Also, training the network using the experimentally generated data set incorporates the mechanical joint approximations and link deformities present in the fabricated model into the predicted results. In addition, this article showcases the application of Euler–Lagrangian formalism on the 3-PPSS parallel manipulator for its dynamic model incorporating the system constraints. The Lagrangian multipliers include the influence of the constraint forces acting on the manipulator platform. For completeness, the analytical model results have been verified using ADAMS for a pre-defined end-effector trajectory.},

Similarity between the data was statistically and qualitatively evaluated.Results In general, synthetic data closely matched original data for epidemic curves, patient characteristics, and outcomes. Synthetic data suppressed labels of zip codes with few total tests (mean=2.9±2.4; max=16 tests; 66% reduction of unique zip codes). Epidemic curves and monthly indicator counts were similar between synthetic and original data in a random sample of the most tested (top 1%; n=171) and for all unsuppressed zip codes (n=5,819), respectively. In small sample sizes, synthetic data utility was notably decreased.Discussion Analyses on the population-level and of densely-tested zip codes (which contained most of the data) were similar between original and synthetically-derived data sets. Analyses of sparsely-tested populations were less similar and had more data suppression.Conclusion In general, synthetic data were successfully used to analyze geospatial and temporal trends. Analyses using small sample sizes or populations were limited, in part due to purposeful data label suppression -an attribute disclosure countermeasure.

   abstract = {<p> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease of humans caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. In this article, we present an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, and use it to estimate the impact, on cases and deaths, of interventions including testing, contact tracing, lockdown, curfew and vaccination. Our model is based on collation, with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly. The model is highly heterogeneous, featuring spatial clustering, over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution. The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020. Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model. In particular, with <italic>R</italic> <sub>0</sub> = 2.45, the SEIR model infects 87% of the resident population while our agent-based model infects only around 23% of the resident population. Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially, but are less effective at reducing deaths. Lockdowns are very effective although costly, while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small. When vaccinating against a future outbreak, our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low coverage, with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30% of the population fully immune. When vaccinating in the midst of an outbreak, the challenge is more difficult. In this context, we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy, capacity, hesitancy and strategy. We conclude that, short of a permanent lockdown, vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19. </p>},

This study focuses on two aspects of technology which are digitization and digitalization of business processes in tourism industry in Malaysia. Due to movement constraints in Covid-19 pandemic, most of the related studies are conducted based on media report, peered review articles and research letters or empirical articles. There is a lack of case study to examine the effectiveness of various factors and how these factors impact the recovery of the post- pandemic tourism industry. A research case in earlier study implies that digitization and digitalization have an impact in recovery of tourism industry and insight gained motivates this study on effectiveness of smart tourism in Malaysia. Hence, this study aims to investigate effectiveness of smart tourism by using a self-developed mobile application which enables multiple trips organize in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Test cases are conducted among eleven managers in travel agencies and positive feedback are collected on system quality, perceived mobility, mobile usefulness, mobile ease of use and usage intention. Findings show that ICT has a major role in reviving business processes when tourism enters recovery phase. The study also discovered the importance of understanding the new patterns emerging which may include new tour packages or travel destinations that are emerging in future. In future work, artificial intelligence or machine learning based smart tourism models are introduced to analyse the new pattern emerging.},

With the aim of protecting patients, students, teachers and healthcare professionals, this paper introduces a prospective sustainable biosafety setting for everyday dental care and education. The setting developed by dental clinicians, epidemiologists, and teachers of dentistry consists of a combination of modern technologies focused on the air-borne part of the viral pathway. The introduced biosafety setting has been clinically evaluated after 18 months of application in the real clinical environment. The protocol has three fundamental pillars: (1) UVC air disinfection; (2) air saturation with certified virucidal essences with nebulizing diffusers; (3) complementary solutions including telehealth and 3D printing. A pseudonymous online smart form was used as the evaluation method. The protocol operates on the premise that everybody is a hypothetical asymptomatic carrier. The results of a clinical evaluation of 115 patient feedbacks imply that no virus transmission from patient to patient or from doctor to nurse was observed or reported using this protocol, and vice versa, although nine patients retrospectively admitted that the clinic visit is likely to be infectious. Despite these promising results, a larger clinical sample and exposition to the current mutated strains are needed for reliable conclusions about protocol virucidal efficiency in current dental environments.},

By surveying and interviewing professionals in Louisiana, this study aims to investigate incentive programs and their effectiveness in reducing the number of at-grade crossings for policy implementation. The results show that most agencies in Louisiana were concerned about safety at railroad crossings with one third supporting closing crossings to alleviate their concerns. In addition, stakeholders were also concerned about the condition and maintenance of crossings, traffic management, and access for active transportation. Among five identified programs, road improvement was ranked as the most effective program, and the combination of multiple programs may be more effective than any individual program. This study recommends that context-sensitive, accessible, and transparent policies, public education, and stakeholder engagement may help to improve safety and efficiency at road-railroad crossings overall.},

Labor platforms have borrowed governance mechanisms from social media to cultivate trust among users and remove problematic content. However, while these platforms may share governance strategies, labor platforms mediate employment relationships between workers and clients with different amounts of power. Based on a multistakeholder ethnography of carework labor platforms, online careworker forums, and interviews, this study describes scams on carework labor platforms. Labor platforms narrate workers into the role of technology consumers, constricting their own obligations to workers. Workers’ explanations of scams vary, with some contesting and others aligning with platform narratives. Some workers seek support in online forums, which remediate the harm of scams for some but also enroll workers in unpaid labor. These scams challenge the assumption of antagonism between the interests of workers and platform companies and highlight the consumerization of work.</p>},

   abstract = {Background: There is an increasing interest in using routinely collected eHealth data to support reflective practice and long-term professional learning. Studies have evaluated the impact of dashboards on clinician decision-making, task completion time, user satisfaction, and adherence to clinical guidelines. Objective: This scoping review aims to summarize the literature on dashboards based on patient administrative, medical, and surgical data for clinicians to support reflective practice. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted in 5 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science) to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. Study selection and characterization were performed by 2 independent reviewers (BB and CP). One reviewer extracted the data that were analyzed descriptively to map the available evidence. Results: A total of 18 dashboards from 8 countries were assessed. Purposes for the dashboards were designed for performance improvement (10/18, 56%), to support quality and safety initiatives (6/18, 33%), and management and operations (4/18, 22%). Data visualizations were primarily designed for team use (12/18, 67%) rather than individual clinicians (4/18, 22%). Evaluation methods varied among asking the clinicians directly (11/18, 61%), observing user behavior through clinical indicators and use log data (14/18, 78%), and usability testing (4/18, 22%). The studies reported high scores on standard usability questionnaires, favorable surveys, and interview feedback. Improvements to underlying clinical indicators were observed in 78% (7/9) of the studies, whereas 22% (2/9) of the studies reported no significant changes in performance. Conclusions: This scoping review maps the current literature landscape on dashboards based on routinely collected clinical indicator data. Although there were common data visualization techniques and clinical indicators used across studies, there was diversity in the design of the dashboards and their evaluation. There was a lack of detail regarding the design processes documented for reproducibility. We identified a lack of interface features to support clinicians in making sense of and reflecting on their personal performance data.},

Compared to RT-PCR, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging is the more consistent, concrete, and prompt method to identify COVID-19 patients. For clinical diagnostics, the information received from computed tomography scans is critical. So there is a need to develop an image analysis technique for detecting viral epidemics from computed tomography scan pictures. Using DenseNet, ResNet, CapsNet, and 3D-ConvNet, four deep machine learning-based architectures have been proposed for COVID-19 diagnosis from chest computed tomography scans. From the experimental results, it is found that all the architectures are providing effective accuracy, of which the COVID-DNet model has reached the highest accuracy of 99%. Proposed architectures are accessible at https://github.com/shamiktiwari/CTscanCovi19 can be utilized to support radiologists and reserachers in validating their initial screening.},

Here we investigate a novel approach to surveillance for transboundary animal diseases using African Swine (ASF) fever as a model. We collected data both at a population level and at the local level on information-seeking behavior respectively through digital data and targeted questionnaire-based surveys to relevant stakeholders such as pig farmers and veterinary authorities. Our study shows how information-seeking behavior and resulting public attention during an epidemic, can be identified through novel data streams from digital platforms such as Wikipedia. Leveraging attention in a critical moment can be key to providing the correct information at the right moment, especially to an interested cohort of people. We also bring evidence on how field surveys aimed at local workers and veterinary authorities remain a crucial tool to assess more in-depth preparedness and awareness among front-line actors. We conclude that these two tools should be used in combination to maximize the outcome of surveillance and prevention activities for selected transboundary animal diseases such as ASF.},

It was shown that the chemical etching has a stochastic nature that can be spotted by correlation or classical machine learning methods. We propose an authentication system that uses a novel regular test pattern for authentication of blister foils. Thanks to this regular test pattern we can identify the cylinder used for printing and the position of the regular test pattern engraved on the authentic cylinder, as well as easily reject the fake patterns printed using counterfeiter cylinder and rotogravure press. The proposed identification/authentication system cannot be easily attacked as it is not possible to imitate the signature of chemical etching process.

To facilitate the advancement of such research, we collect and curate the DepreST Call and Text log (DepreST-CAT) dataset from over 365 crowdsourced participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The logs are labeled with traditional anxiety and depression screening scores essential for training machine learning models. We construct time series ranging from 2 to 16 weeks in length from the retrospective smartphone logs. To demonstrate the screening capabilities of these time series, we then train a variety of unimodal and multimodal machine and deep learning models. These models provide insights into the relative screening value of the different types of logs, lengths of log time series, and classification methods. The DepreST-CAT dataset is a valuable resource for the research community to model communication patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic and further the development of machine learning algorithms for passive mental illness screening.},

With traditional screening questionnaires too burdensome to achieve universal screening in this population, data collected through mobile applications has the potential to rapidly identify at-risk students. While prior research has mostly focused on collecting passive smartphone modalities from students, smartphone sensors are also capable of capturing active modalities. The general public has demonstrated more willingness to share active than passive modalities through an app, yet no such dataset of active mobile modalities for mental illness screening exists for students. Knowing which active modalities hold strong screening capabilities for student populations is critical for developing targeted mental illness screening technology. Thus, we deployed a mobile application to over 300 students during the COVID-19 pandemic to collect the Student Suicidal Ideation and Depression Detection (StudentSADD) dataset. We report on a rich variety of machine learning models including cutting-edge multimodal pretrained deep learning classifiers on active text and voice replies to screen for depression and suicidal ideation.

Most techniques in the literature focus on identifying the individual pieces of misinformation or fake news based on a set of stylistic, content-derived features, user profiles or sharing statistics. Recently, those methods have been extended to identify spreaders. However, they are not enough to effectively detect either fake content or the users spreading it. In this context, this paper presents an initial proof of concept of a deep learning model for identifying fake news spreaders in social media, focusing not only on the characteristics of the shared content but also on user interactions and the resulting content propagation tree structures. Although preliminary, an experimental evaluation over COVID-related data showed promising results, significantly outperforming other alternatives in the literature.},

   abstract = {The current global pandemic, Covid-19, is a severe threat to human health and existence especially when it is mutating very frequently. Being a novel disease, Covid-19 is impacting the patients with comorbidities and is predicted to have long-term consequences, even for those who have recovered from it. To clearly recognize its impact, it is important to comprehend the complex relationship between Covid-19 and other diseases. It is also being observed that people with good immune system are less susceptible to the disease. It is perceived that if a correlation between Covid-19, other diseases, and diet is realized, then caregivers would be able to enhance their further course of medical action and recommendations. Network Analysis is one such technique that can bring forth such complex interdependencies and associations. In this paper, a Network Analysis–based approach has been proposed for analyzing the interplay of diets/foods along with Covid-19 and other diseases. Relationships between Covid-19, diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and diets have been curated, visualized, and further analyzed in this study so as to predict unknown associations. Network algorithms including Louvain graph algorithm (LA), K nearest neighbors (KNN), and Page rank algorithms (PR) have been employed for predicting a total of 60 disease-diet associations, out of which 46 have been found to be either significant in disease risk prevention/mitigation or in its progression as validated using PubMed literature. A precision of 76.7% has been achieved which is significant considering the involvement of a novel disease like Covid-19. The generated interdependencies can be further explored by medical professionals and caregivers in order to plan healthy eating patterns for Covid-19 patients. The proposed approach can also be utilized for finding beneficial diets for different combinations of comorbidities with Covid-19 as per the underlying health conditions of a patient.

   abstract = {This paper aims to identify bundles of Healthcare 4.0 (H4.0) digital applications and measure the impacts of their adoption on patient-centered performance. We conducted an empirical-exploratory study based on a survey with 119 middle/senior managers from different hospitals. Multivariate data techniques were applied to identify the H4.0 bundles, create combined adoption measures and analyze associations between H4.0 adoption and performance. Configuration theory provided the theoretical underpinnings to explain the relationships among the investigated elements. Four bundles of H4.0 digital applications were proposed: Smart Healthcare Supply Chain, Smart Patient Diagnosis, Smart Patient Treatment, and Smart Patient Follow-up. We found that high H4.0 adoption scores in hospitals positively impact patient-centered performance, measured through five indicators (patient readmission rate, mortality rate, length-of-stay, satisfaction, and safety). As the utilized measures for H4.0 digital applications were initially raised from academic works and validated based on practitioners' perceptions, the establishment of bundles brings a more practical oriented framework with a strong theoretical background, which is still scarce in the literature. Instead of addressing a wide range of concerns related to H4.0, the proposed bundles focus on the most popular and relevant aspects in a hospital with a significant impact on patients' interests.},

Although the relevance of new technologies as strategic levers for crisis resolution has been widely debated before the pandemic, especially in the smart cities' context, how individuals have agreed to include the technological changes dictated by the pandemic in their daily interactions remains an open question. This paper aims at detecting citizens' sentiment toward technology before and after the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic using Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA) to analyze a large corpus of tweets. Specifically, citizens' attitudes in five cities (Berlin, Dublin, London, Milan, and Madrid) were explored to extract and classify the key topics related to the degree of confidence, familiarity and approval of new technologies. The results shed light on the complex technology acceptance process and help managers identify the potential negative effects of smart technologies. In this way, the study enhances scholars' and practitioners' understanding of the strategies for enabling the use of technology within smart cities to manage the transformations introduced by the health emergency and guide citizens’ behaviour.},

In tourism, group package tours have become a common touring approach; however, research in investigating tourists’ journey experiences facilitated by modern technologies such as AR remains rare. This study aims to examine factors affecting tourists’ behavioral intentions to choose group package tours. An extended theory of the planned behavior model with three antecedents—destination image, perceived certainty, and experiential value— is posited to evaluate the potential influence of AR. Using data of 557 survey respondents, the structural equation modeling shows a good fit for the empirical results. The findings reveal that AR gives tourists access to more explicit destination images, increases the certainty of group package tours, and creates experiential value during a trip, thereby enhancing behavioral intentions to opt for a group package tour. The study concludes with theoretical and empirical implications for tourism and related industries.},

   abstract = {New product development to enhance companies’ competitiveness and reputation is one of the leading activities in manufacturing. At present, achieving successful product design has become more difficult, even for companies with extensive capabilities in the market, because of disorganisation in the fuzzy front end (FFE) of the innovation process. Tremendous amounts of information, such as data on customers, manufacturing capability, and market trend, are considered in the FFE phase to avoid common flaws in product design. Because of the high degree of uncertainties in the FFE, multidimensional and high-volume data are added from time to time at the beginning of the formal product development process. To address the above concerns, deploying big data analytics to establish industrial intelligence is an active but still under-researched area. In this paper, an intelligent product design framework is proposed to incorporate fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) and a genetic algorithm (GA) into a recursive association-rule-based fuzzy inference system to bridge the gap between customer attributes and design parameters. Considering the current incidence of epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, communication of information in the FFE stage may be hindered. Through this study, a recursive learning scheme is established, therefore, to strengthen market performance, design performance, and sustainability on product design. It is found that the industrial big data analytics in the FFE process achieve greater flexibility and self-improvement mechanism on the evolution of product design.},

SSCM is a type of information flow management that facilitates cooperation and collaboration among supply chain players and stakeholders while considering economic, social, and environmental perspectives. Previous studies have failed to (1) generate these indicators from databases and confirm the validity of the effective indicators; (2) build a hierarchical structure with interrelationships under industrial disruption and ambidexterity; and (3) identify the indicators necessary for effective textile performance. The proposed hybrid method generates indicators from a database and based on the existing literature. This study proposes using the fuzzy Delphi method to validate these indicators in the textile industry and applies the best and worst methods to examine the most effective and ineffective indicators. Valid aspects and criteria are used to construct a hierarchical structure under conditions of industrial disruption and ambidexterity. The results show that the most important aspects are financial vulnerability, supply chain uncertainty, risk assessment, and resilience; these aspects are drivers that are guaranteed to ensure the effectiveness of SSCM under industrial disruption and ambidexterity. Financial crisis response, business continuity, supply chain integration, bullwhip effect, facility location, and supplier selection are highlighted as vital practical strategies.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we present a combined forecasting and optimization decision-support tool to assist air cargo revenue management departments in the acceptance/rejection process of incoming cargo bookings. We consider the case of a combination airline and focus on the passenger aircraft belly capacity. The process is dynamic (bookings are received in a discrete fashion during the booking horizon) and uncertain (for some bookings the three dimensions are not provided, while the actual belly space available for cargo is only revealed a few hours before departure). Hence, analysts base decisions on historical data or human experience, which might yield sub-optimal or infeasible solutions due to the aforementioned uncertainties. We tackle them by proposing data-driven algorithms to predict available cargo space and shipment dimensions. A packing problem is solved sequentially once a new booking request is received, predicting shipment dimensions, if necessary, and considering the uncertainty of such prediction. The booking is accepted if it results in a feasible loading configuration where no previously accepted booking is offloaded. When applied in a deterministic context, our packing method outperformed the one used by the partner airline, increasing the loaded volume up to 20%. The framework was also tested assuming unknown shipment dimensions, comparing a risk-prone and a risk-averse strategy, with the latter accounting for uncertainty in dimension predictions and the former using mean values. While the average loaded volume decreases in the risk-averse case, the number of unplanned offloadings due to under-predicted dimensions decreases from 54% to 12% of the simulated cases, hence yielding a more robust acceptance strategy.},

The crisis has been described as a great work-from-home experiment, with platform ecosystems positing as its most advanced form. Our analysis differentiates the direct (health) and indirect (economic) risks incurred by workers, to critically assess the portrayal of platforms as buffers against crisis-induced layoffs. We submit that platform-mediated labor may eventually increase precarity, without necessarily reducing health risks for workers. Our argument is based on a comparison of the three main categories of platform work—“on-demand labor” (gigs such as delivery and transportation), “online labor” (tasks performed remotely, such as data annotation), and “social networking labor” (content generation and moderation). We discuss the strategies that platforms deploy to transfer risk from clients onto workers, thus deepening existing power imbalances between them. These results question the problematic equivalence between work-from-home and platform labor. Instead of attaining the advantages of the former in terms of direct and indirect risk mitigation, an increasing number of platformized jobs drift toward high economic and insuppressible health risks.},

One of the crucial reasons why the spread of the virus was difficult to stop was the viral evolution over time. The emergence of new virus variants is hindering the development of effective drugs and vaccines. Moreover, they contribute e.g. to virus transmissibility or viral immune evasion. This fact has led to increased importance of understanding genomic data related to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we are proposing sarscov2vec, a new application of continuous vector space representation on novel species of coronaviruses genomes. With its core methodology of genome feature extraction step and being supervised by a Machine Learning model, this tool is designed to distinguish the most common five different SARS-CoV-2 variants: Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma and Omicron. In this research we used 367,004 unique genome sequence records from the official virus repositories, where 25,000 sequences were randomly selected and used to train the Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm. The next 36,365 samples were processed by a Machine Learning pipeline. Our research results show that the final hiper-tuned classification model achieved 99% of accuracy on the test set. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the continuous vector space representation of SARS-CoV-2 genomes can be decomposed into 2D vector space and visualized as a method of explaining Machine Learning model decisions.},

   abstract = {<p>COVID-19 has changed the lifestyle of many people due to its rapid human-to-human transmission. The spread started at the end of January 2020, and different countries used different approaches in terms of testing, sanitization, lock down and quarantine centres to control the spread of the virus. People are getting back to working and routine life activities with new normal standards of testing, sanitization, social distancing and lock down. People are regularly tested to identify those who are infected with COVID-19 and isolate them from general public. However, testing all people unnecessarily is an expensive operation in terms of resources usage. There must be an optimal policy to test only those who have higher chances of being COVID-19 positive. Similarly, sanitization is used for individuals and streets to disinfect people and places. However, sanitization is also an expensive operation in terms of resources, and it is not possible to disinfect each and every individual and street. Social separating or lock down or quarantine centres focuses are different methodologies that are utilised to control the human-to-human transmission of the infection and separate the individuals who are contaminated with COVID-19. However, lock down and quarantine centres are expensive operations in terms of resources as it disturbs the affairs of state and the growth of economy. At the same time, it negatively affects the quality of life of a society. It is also not possible to provide resources to all citizens by locking them inside homes or quarantine centres for infinite time. All these parameters are expensive in terms of resources and have an effect on controlling the spread of the virus, quality of life of human, resources and economy. In this article, a novel intelligent method based on reinforcement learning (RL) is built up that quantifies the unique levels of testing, disinfection and lock down alongside its impact on the spread of the infection, personal satisfaction or quality of life, resource use and economy. Different RL algorithms are actualized and agents are prepared with these algorithms to interact with the environment to gain proficiency with the best strategy. The examinations exhibit that deep learning–based algorithms, for example, DQN and DDPG are performing better than customary RL algorithms, for example, Q-Learning and SARSA.</p>},

   abstract = {The rapid spread of contagious diseases poses a colossal threat to human existence. Presently, the emergence of coronavirus COVID-19 which has rightly been declared a global pandemic resulting in so many deaths, confusion as well as huge economic losses is a challenge. It has been suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with different Government authorities of the world and non-governmental organizations, that efforts to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic should rely principally on measures such as social distancing, identification of infected persons, tracing of possible contacts as well as effective isolation of such person(s) for subsequent medical treatment. The aim of this study is to provide a framework for monitoring Movements of Pandemic Disease Patients and predicting their next geographical locations given the recent trend of infected COVID-19 patients absconding from isolation centres as evidenced in the Nigerian case. The methodology for this study, proposes a system architecture incorporating GPS (Global Positioning System) and Assisted-GPS technologies for monitoring the geographical movements of COVID-19 patients and recording of their movement Trajectory Datasets on the assumption that they are assigned with GPS-enabled devices such as smartphones. Accordingly, fifteen (15) participants (patients) were selected for this study based on the criteria of residency and business activity location. The ensuing participants movements generated 157, 218 Trajectory datasets during a period of 3&nbsp;weeks. With this dataset, mining of the movement trace, Stay Points (hot spots), relationships, and the prediction of the next probable geographical location of a COVID-19 patient was realized by the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Mining techniques such as supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (i.e., Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting regression(XGBR) as well as density-based clustering methods (i.e., DBSCAN) for the computation of Stay Points (hot spots) of COVID-19 patient. The result of this study showed clearly that it is possible to determine the Stay Points (hot spots) of a COVID-19 patient. In addition, this study demonstrated the possibility of predicting the next probable geographical location of a COVID-19 patient. Correspondingly, Six Machine Learning models (i.e., MLR, kNN, DTR, RFR, GBR, and XGBR) were compared for efficiency, in determining the next probable location of a COVID-19 patient. The result showed that the DTR model performed better compared to other models (i.e., MLR, kNN, RFR, GBR, XGBR) based on four evaluation matrices (i.e., ACCURACY, MAE, MSE, and R2) used. It is recommended that less developed Countries consider adopting this framework as a policy initiative for implementation at this burgeoning phase of COVID-19 infection and beyond. The same applies to the developed Countries. There is indication that GPS Trajectory dataset and Machine Learning algorithms as applied in this paper, appear to possess the potential of performing optimally in a real-life situation of monitoring a COVID-19 patient. This paper is unique given its ability to predict the next probable location of a COVID-19 patient. In the review of extant literature, prediction of the next probable location of a COVID-19 patient was not in evidence using the same Machine Learning algorithms.},

   abstract = {Having a complete and reliable list of risk factors from routine laboratory blood test for COVID-19 disease severity and mortality is important for patient care and hospital management. It is common to use meta-analysis to combine analysis results from different studies to make it more reproducible. In this paper, we propose to run multiple analyses on the same set of data to produce a more robust list of risk factors. With our time-to-event survival data, the standard survival analysis were extended in three directions. The first is to extend from tests and corresponding p-values to machine learning and their prediction performance. The second is to extend from single-variable to multiple-variable analysis. The third is to expand from analyzing time-to-decease data with death as the event of interest to analyzing time-to-hospital-release data to treat early recovery as a meaningful event as well. Our extension of the type of analyses leads to ten ranking lists. We conclude that 20 out of 30 factors are deemed to be reliably associated to faster-death or faster-recovery. Considering correlation among factors and evidenced by stepwise variable selection in random survival forest, 10 ~ 15 factors seem to be able to achieve the optimal prognosis performance. Our final list of risk factors contain calcium, white blood cell and neutrophils count, urea and creatine, D-dimer, red cell distribution widths, age, ferritin, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocyte, basophils, anemia related factors (hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration), sodium, potassium, eosinophils, and aspartate aminotransferase.},

   abstract = {Supply Chain processes are continuously marred by myriad factors including varying demands, changing routes, major disruptions, and compliance issues. Therefore, supply chains require monitoring and ongoing optimization. Data science uses real-time data to provide analytical insights, leading to automation and improved decision making. RFID is an ideal technology to source big data, particularly in supply chains, because RFID tags are consumed across supply chain process, which includes scanning raw materials, completing products, transporting goods, and storing products, with accuracy and speed. This study carries out a systematic literature review of research articles published during the timeline (2000-2021) that discuss the role of RFID technology in developing decision support systems that optimize supply chains in light of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the study offers recommendations on operational efficiency of supply chains while reducing the costs of implementing the RFID technology. The core contribution of this paper is its analysis and evaluation of various RFID implementation methods in supply chains with the aim of saving time effectively and achieving cost efficiencies.},

   abstract = {Patient empowerment is an indispensable precondition for patients to self-manage their disease. The article takes the position that patients are empowered for disease self-management through patient knowledge empowerment when sharing knowledge. One of the most important instruments to successfully empower a patient to manage a chronic disease and maintain social relations, which are also a precondition for the prevention of chronic illnesses, is the possibility to access online health communities (OHCs) and participate in them. The aim of the article is to model possible development scenarios of OHCs as enablers of patient knowledge in relation to other digital health technologies (DHTs). A foresight methodology was used to achieve the goal, employing a technology scanning approach after selecting 10 foresight studies, which resulted in four future scenario models for the empowerment of patients wcith chronic diseases through digital health communities. They reveal options for the future interoperability of OHCs with other DHTs and highlight their importance and significance for the healthcare system as a technology for balancing patient self-efficacy and social relations as well as the need to maintain and develop them.},

Contributors emphasize the importance of evaluating equity between rich and poor countries and other forms of climate injustice. The role of the evaluation is questioned: what can evaluation be expected to do on its own and what requires collaboration across disciplines, professions and civil society – and across generations? Contributors discuss the implications of the post-Glasgow climate ‘pact’ for the continued relevance of evaluation. Should evaluators advocate for the marginalized and become activists on behalf of sustainability and climate justice – as well as advocates of evidence? Accountability-driven and evidence-based evaluation is needed to assess the effectiveness of investments in adaptation and mitigation. Causal pathways in different settings and ‘theories of no-change’ are needed to understand gaps between stakeholder promises and delivery. Evaluators should measure unintended consequences and what is often left unmeasured, and be sensitive to failure and unanticipated effects of funded actions. Evaluation timescales and units of analysis beyond particular programmes are needed to evaluate the complexities of climate change, sustainability and to take account of natural systems. The implications for evaluation commissioning and funding are discussed as well as the role of evaluation in programme-design and implementation.},

   abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are highly susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, with multiple reports of widespread spillover of virus from humans to free-living deer. While the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron variant of concern (VoC) has been shown to be notably more transmissible amongst humans, its ability to cause infection and spillover to non-human animals remains a challenge of concern. We found that 19 of the 131 (14.5%; 95% CI: 0.100.22) white-tailed deer opportunistically sampled on Staten Island, New York, between December 12, 2021, and January 31, 2022, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific serum antibodies using a surrogate virus neutralization assay, indicating prior exposure. The results also revealed strong evidence of age-dependence in antibody prevalence. A significantly (χ2, p &lt; 0.001) greater proportion of yearling deer possessed neutralizing antibodies as compared with fawns (OR=12.7; 95% CI 437.5). Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in nasal swabs from seven of 68 (10.29%; 95% CI: 0.00.20) of the sampled deer, and whole-genome sequencing identified the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VoC (B.1.1.529) is circulating amongst the white-tailed deer on Staten Island. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the deer Omicron sequences clustered closely with other, recently reported Omicron sequences recovered from infected humans in New York City and elsewhere, consistent with human to deer spillover. Interestingly, one individual deer was positive for viral RNA and had a high level of neutralizing antibodies, suggesting either rapid serological conversion during an ongoing infection or a breakthrough infection in a previously exposed animal. Together, our findings show that the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron VoC can infect white-tailed deer and highlights an urgent need for comprehensive surveillance of susceptible animal species to identify ecological transmission networks and better assess the potential risks of spillback to humans.Key Findings These studies provide strong evidence of infection of free-living white-tailed deer with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron variant of concern on Staten Island, New York, and highlight an urgent need for investigations on human-to-animal-to-human spillovers/spillbacks as well as on better defining the expanding host-range of SARS-CoV-2 in non-human animals and the environment.Competing Interest StatementThe J.A.R laboratory received support from Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Xing Technologies and Zoetis, outside of the reported work.

The prediction of vaccine decision making and the interpretation of the analytical relationships among variables that encompass public perceptions and attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic have been extensively limited to the studies conducted after the administration of the first FDA-approved vaccine in December of 2020. In order to fill the gap in the literature, we used six predictive models and identified the most important factors, via Gini importance measures, that contribute to the prediction of COVID-19 vaccine acceptors and refusers using a nationwide survey that was administered in November 2020, before the widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines. Concerns about (re)contracting COVID-19 and opinions regarding mandatory face covering were identified as the most important predictors of vaccine decision making. By investigating the vaccine acceptors and refusers before the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, we can help public health officials design and deliver individually tailored and dynamic vaccination programs that can increase the overall vaccine uptake.},

However, little is known about the experiences of pre-service teachers who play a key role in educating future generations. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring Finnish pre-service teachers’ conceptions and experiences of data agency in social media environments. Drawing from in-depth interviews of pre-service teachers (N = 14), the analysis revealed that pre-service teachers construct their data agency in terms of social frames and shared social norms, and they also recognize the lack of understanding regarding wider socio-technical systems within which data agencies are situated. This research argues that without a sophisticated understanding of algorithmic governance and commercial use of data, it is unlikely that these future teachers would be prepared to facilitate children’s and youth’s agentive actions in a data-driven society.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a method for biometric-driven facial image recognition, based on multivariate correlation analysis, which extracts geometrical feature points and low-level visual features. The low-level visual features, such as colour and texture, are extracted at local from the selected prominent regions of the facial image. The geometrical features are captured using the Active Shape Model (ASM). The colour features are extracted from the YCbCr colour model, and the autocorrelation method is deployed to extract the texture features. The extracted features are formed as a feature tensor matrix. The feature matrix of the key face image is compared to the feature matrices of the target face image that are stored in the feature vector database using the Canonical Correlation method. The correlation between the key and target feature matrices is tested, whether it is highly significant or not. If it is significantly correlated, then it is inferred that the key and target face images are the same; otherwise, it is concluded that they are different. The benchmark facial image datasets, GT, LFW, and Pointing ’04 datasets, considered for the experiments; in addition to the datasets, a facial image database has been constructed with celebrities on our interest which has also been subjected to experiments. The proposed method resulted in a mean precision score (mP@α) of 95.27%, 94.20%, 96.19%, and 96.05 for GT, LFW, Pointing ‘04, and our datasets, respectively. Also, the F-score was calculated that are, 96.78%, 95.15%, 97.08%, and 96.96% for GT, LFW, Pointing ‘04, and our datasets, respectively. The results obtained by the proposed method are comparable to the existing methods.},

   abstract = {With the rise of social media, cyberharassment (e.g., cyberbullying and cyberhate) has become more prevalent in daily interactions and has thus been identified as a critical social problem. It often involves inappropriate online behavior and deliberate cyber threats against individuals, or specific social groups on the grounds of characteristics such as race, sexual orientation, gender, or religious affiliation. For instance, the Cyberbullying Research Center reported that 37% of middle and high school students have been cyberbullied during their lifetime, and this number is expected to further increase as teens continue to have an increased online presence. In a recent Pew survey [1], roughly four in ten (i.e., 41%) Americans reported personally experiencing varying degrees of harassment and bullying online, and Internet users all over world (i.e., 48%) have also reported having similar experiences [2, 3]. Furthermore, the new waves of anti-Asian hate [4, 5], mask-related hate [6, 7] and vaccine-related hate [8, 9] set-off by the COVID-19 pandemic have had a devastating effect on our society globally.Although Machine Learning (ML) has immense potential for automatic cyberharassment detection, and researchers are increasingly using ML techniques to address this important social problem, they face key challenges to effectively address cyberharassment using ML. We identify three pertinent challenges in defending against cyberharassment in the era of ML. First, the representation of cyberharassment has shifted from traditional text-based cyberharassment to multimodal (i.e., both texts and images) cyberharassment, which poses new challenges to effective cyberharassment detection. Second, cyberharassment is a fast-evolving phenomenon, whether fueled by current events or by people looking for new ways to evade cyberharassment detection systems with techniques such as adversarial examples against ML-based models. Third, in spite of the recent advances in ML in cyberharassment detection, the robustness of these ML models in an adversarial setting remains poorly understood. In this dissertation, we focus on understanding and defending against cyberharassment using ML techniques, and studying the robustness of ML models employed in cyberharassment defense. We are interested in (1) understanding and defending against visual cyberbullying (i.e. cyberbullying via images), (2) understanding, detecting and explaining online hateful content, and (3) studying the robustness of ML models employed in cyberharassment defense. In the area of visual cyberbullying defense, we discover five visual factors of cyberbullying in images, and develop a multimodal deep learning model that detects cyberbullying content in images based on those factors. In online hateful content understanding, detection and explanation, we carry out an in-depth analysis of COVID-19-related hateful tweets, and discovered new keywords used to disseminate COVID-19-related hate speech using BERT attention mechanism. Additionally, we carry out further studies to understand the nature of online hate, and discover that new waves of online hate, such as hate related to masks and vaccines witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic are a core issue limiting the effectiveness of traditional detectors in practical applications, and propose a new ML methodology based on attribute-based Zero Shot Learning to effectively address new waves of hateful content. Lastly, in the area of ML model robustness, we study the robustness of multimodal models against adversarial attacks using a novel attack algorithm based on decoupling input modalities.},

External morphology, shell and reproductive system were in accordance with the known for the species, except by some peculiarities in the shell and radula. A single haplotype was found, which was 100% similar to sequences of COI available in GenBank for specimens from Japan and Argentina. The species is adapted to many habitats and seems to be rapidly expanding its distribution in Southeastern and Southern Brazil, and other South America countries. We demonstrate the importance of monitoring O. fulgens, considering its potential to compete with native molluscs, attack several plants, and be a possible transmitter of diseases.},

The advent of digital pathology (DP) and an increase in computational power have led to the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools that can assist pathologists and pulmonologists in improving clinical workflow and patient management. While previous works have explored the advances in computational approaches for breast, prostate, and head and neck cancers, there has been a growing interest in applying these technologies to lung diseases as well. The application of AI tools on radiology images for better characterization of indeterminate lung nodules, fibrotic lung disease, and lung cancer risk stratification has been well documented. In this article, we discuss methodologies used to build AI tools in lung DP, describing the various hand-crafted and deep learning-based unsupervised feature approaches. Next, we review AI tools across a wide spectrum of lung diseases including cancer, tuberculosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and COVID-19. We discuss the utility of novel imaging biomarkers for different types of clinical problems including quantification of biomarkers like PD-L1, lung disease diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of response to treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. We also look briefly at some emerging applications of AI tools in lung DP such as multimodal data analysis, 3D pathology, and transplant rejection. Lastly, we discuss the future of DP-based AI tools, describing the challenges with regulatory approval, developing reimbursement models, planning clinical deployment, and addressing AI biases. © 2022 The Authors.

Responsible for assisting in detecting numerous pathologies and findings that directly interfere in the patient's life, this exam is therefore crucial in screening patients. This work proposes a methodology based on a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ensemble to aid the diagnosis of chest X-ray exams by screening them with a high probability of being normal or abnormal. In the development of this study, a private dataset with frontal and lateral projections X-ray images was used. To build the ensemble model, VGG-16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 architectures, which are commonly used in the classification of Chest X-rays, were evaluated. A Confidence Threshold (CTR) was used to define the predictions into High Confidence Normal (HCn), Borderline classification (BC), or High Confidence Abnormal (HCa). In the tests performed, very promising results were achieved: 54.63% of the exams were classified with high confidence; of the normal exams, 32% were classified as HCn with an false discovery rate (FDR) of 1.68%; and as to the abnormal exams, 23% were classified as HCa with 4.91% false omission rate (FOR).},

Standard methods, including maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches, generally rely on complex mathematical formulae and approximations, and do not scale with dataset size. We develop a likelihood-free, simulation-based approach, which combines deep learning with (1) a large set of summary statistics measured on phylogenies or (2) a complete and compact representation of trees, which avoids potential limitations of summary statistics and applies to any phylodynamics model. Our method enables both model selection and estimation of epidemiological parameters from very large phylogenies. We demonstrate its speed and accuracy on simulated data, where it performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. To illustrate its applicability, we assess the dynamics induced by superspreading individuals in an HIV dataset of men-having-sex-with-men in Zurich.

   abstract = {Cyberhate represents a risk to adolescents’ development and peaceful coexistence in democratic societies. Yet, not much is known about the relationship between adolescents’ ability to cope with cyberhate and their cyberhate involvement. To fill current gaps in the literature and inform the development of media education programs, the present study investigated various coping strategies in a hypothetical cyberhate scenario as correlates for being cyberhate victims, perpetrators, and both victim–perpetrators. The sample consisted of 6829 adolescents aged 12–18 years old (Mage = 14.93, SD = 1.64; girls: 50.4%, boys: 48.9%, and 0.7% did not indicate their gender) from Asia, Europe, and North America. Results showed that adolescents who endorsed distal advice or endorsed technical coping showed a lower likelihood to be victims, perpetrators, or victim–perpetrators. In contrast, if adolescents felt helpless or endorsed retaliation to cope with cyberhate, they showed higher odds of being involved in cyberhate as victims, perpetrators, or victim–perpetrators. Finally, adolescents who endorsed close support as a coping strategy showed a lower likelihood to be victim–perpetrators, and adolescents who endorsed assertive coping showed higher odds of being victims. In conclusion, the results confirm the importance of addressing adolescents’ ability to deal with cyberhate to develop more tailored prevention approaches. More specifically, such initiatives should focus on adolescents who feel helpless or feel inclined to retaliate. In addition, adolescents should be educated to practice distal advice and technical coping when experiencing cyberhate. Implications for the design and instruction of evidence-based cyberhate prevention (e.g., online educational games, virtual learning environments) will be discussed.},

However, the debate about the presence or absence of risk compensation for universal mandatory mask-wearing rules - especially in the context of COVID-19 - is not settled yet. Methods Mobility is used as a proxy for risky behaviour before and after the mask mandates. Two sets of regressions are estimated to decipher (any) risk-compensating effect of mask mandate in Bangladesh. These include: (1) intervention regression analysis of daily activities at six types of locations, using pre-mask-mandate and post-mandate data; and (2) multiple regression analysis of daily new COVID-19 cases on daily mobility (lagged) to establish mobility as a valid proxy. Results (1) Statistically, mobility increased at all five non-residential locations, while home stays decreased after the mask mandate was issued; (2) daily mobility had a statistically significant association on daily new cases (with around 10 days of lag). Both significances were calculated at 95% confidence level. Conclusion Community mobility had increased (and stay at home decreased) after the mandatory mask-wearing rule, and given mobility is associated with increases in new COVID-19 cases, there is evidence of risk compensation effect of the mask mandate - at least partially - in Bangladesh.},

   abstract = {Sound waves from speech can potentially induce vibrations, proportional to the speech signal, on nearby objects. Each of these objects introduces the risk for a malicious attacker to exploit the induced vibrations to eavesdrop on the speech. Such an eavesdropping attack is critical when we consider the potential for induced vibrations in standard magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs). As an instance of this threat, prior research has demonstrated that speech in certain scenarios can induce vibrations on the read/write head of an HDD in order to eavesdrop on the speech (Kwong et al.; Oakland'19). In this paper, we revisit this line of research and aim to provide a closer investigation into whether HDDs can in fact be used as a source for eavesdropping on speech vibrations. As a foundation for our study, we utilize an effective, and robust methodology using laser vibrometry to measure the subtle speech vibrations induced on the read/write head. The prior study tested only a single HDD and only machine-rendered speech in a single setting with very loud speech. Our work broadens the scope of this research in many significant ways. First, we test multiple popular HDDs of different models and sizes to evaluate the generalizability of the overall threat. Second, we evaluate the threat from live human speech spoken near an HDD, expanding the scope of the attack to include most real-world speech settings involving normal human conversations. Third, we define machine-rendered speech scenarios to explore different propagation media and degrees of speech loudness. Our findings are two-fold. First, we observed that live human speech traveling through the air is not generally strong enough to impact HDDs such that intelligible speech information is leaked. Second, most tested HDDs did not seem capable of eavesdropping on machine-rendered speech unless the speech is loud enough, or the HDD shares a surface or is in direct contact with the speaker device. This implies HDDs cannot eavesdrop live human speech.},

   abstract = {<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><h3>Purpose</h3><p>Performing measurement-based patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) is recognized as a resource-intensive and time inefficient task in the radiotherapy treatment workflow. Paired with technological refinements in modern radiotherapy, research towards measurement-free PSQA has seen increased interest over the last five years. However, these efforts have not been clinically implemented or prospectively validated in the U.S. We propose a virtual QA (VQA) system and workflow to assess the safety and workload reduction of measurement-free PSQA.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>An XGBoost machine learning model was designed to predict PSQA outcomes of VMAT plans, represented as percent differences between the measured ion chamber point dose in a phantom and the corresponding planned dose. The final model was deployed within a web application to predict PSQA outcomes of clinical plans within an existing clinical workflow. The application also displays relevant feature importance and plan-specific distribution analyses relative to database plans for documentation and to aid physicist interpretation and evaluation. VQA predictions were prospectively validated over three months of measurements at our clinic to assess safety and efficiency gains.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Over three months, VQA predictions for 445 VMAT plans were prospectively validated at our institution. VQA predictions for these plans had a mean absolute error of 1.08 +/- 0.77%, with a maximum absolute error of 2.98%. Employing a 1% prediction threshold (i.e. plans predicted to have an absolute error of less than 1% would not require a measurement) would yield a 69.2% reduction in QA workload – saving 32.5 hours per month on average – with 81.5%/72.4%/0.81 sensitivity/specificity/AUC at a 3% clinical threshold and 100%/70%/0.93 sensitivity/specificity/AUC at a 4% clinical threshold.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>This is the first prospective clinical implementation and validation of VQA in the U.S., which we observed to be efficient. Using a conservative threshold, VQA can substantially reduce the number of required measurements for PSQA, leading to more effective allocation of clinical resources.</p>},

Nor is it discussed how such representations can account for the common psycho-socio-behavior of the information consumers. This work takes a data-driven analytical approach to (1) describe the prominent lexical and grammatical features of COVID-19 misinformation; (2) interpret the underlying (psycho-)linguistic triggers in terms of sentiment, power and activity based on the affective control theory; (3) study the feature indexing for anti-infodemic modeling. The results show distinct language generalization patterns of misinformation of favoring evaluative terms and multimedia devices in delivering a negative sentiment. Such appeals are effective to arouse people’s sympathy toward the vulnerable community and foment their spreading behavior.},

   abstract = {Identifying the potential compound–protein interactions (CPIs) plays an essential role in drug development. The computational approaches for CPI prediction can reduce time and costs of experimental methods and have benefited from the continuously improved graph representation learning. However, most of the network-based methods use heterogeneous graphs, which is challenging due to their complex structures and heterogeneous attributes. Therefore, in this work, we transformed the compound–protein heterogeneous graph to a homogeneous graph by integrating the ligand-based protein representations and overall similarity associations. We then proposed an Inductive Graph AggrEgator-based framework, named CPI-IGAE, for CPI prediction. CPI-IGAE learns the low-dimensional representations of compounds and proteins from the homogeneous graph in an end-to-end manner. The results show that CPI-IGAE performs better than some state-of-the-art methods. Further ablation study and visualization of embeddings reveal the advantages of the model architecture and its role in feature extraction, and some of the top ranked CPIs by CPI-IGAE have been validated by a review of recent literature.

As such, we reviewed 49 well-chosen studies to reveal the impact of geo-environmental factors (including the natural environment and human activity) on global COVID-19 transmission, and to inform critical intervention strategies that could mitigate the worldwide effects of the pandemic. Existing studies frequently mention the impact of climate factors (e.g., temperature and humidity); in contrast, a more decisive influence can be achieved by human activity, including human mobility, health factors, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The above results exhibit distinct spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The related analytical methodology consists of sensitivity analysis, mathematical modeling, and risk analysis. For future studies, we recommend highlighting geo-environmental interactions, developing geographically statistical models for multiple waves of the pandemic, and investigating NPIs and care patterns.

   abstract = {Vehicles can utilize their sensors or receive messages from other vehicles to acquire information about the surrounding environments. However, the information may be inaccurate, faulty, or maliciously compromised due to sensor failures, communication faults, or security attacks. The goal of this work is to detect if a lane-changing decision and the sensed or received information are anomalous. We develop three anomaly detection approaches based on deep learning: a classifier approach, a predictor approach, and a hybrid approach combining the classifier and the predictor. All of them do not need anomalous data nor lateral features so that they can generally consider lane-changing decisions before the vehicles start moving along the lateral axis. They achieve at least 82% and up to 93% F<inf>1</inf> scores against anomaly on data from Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) [1] and HighD [2]. We also examine system properties and verify that the detected anomaly includes more dangerous scenarios.},

Large volumes of heterogeneous health records require advanced visualization and visual analytics systems to uncover valuable insight buried in complex databases. As a vibrant sub-field of information visualization and visual analytics, many interactive EHR and PopHR visualization (EHR Vis) systems have been proposed, developed, and evaluated by clinicians to support effective clinical analysis and decision making. We present the state-of-the-art (STAR) of EHR Vis literature and open access healthcare data sources and provide an up-to-date overview on this important topic. We identify trends and challenges in the field, introduce novel literature and data classifications, and incorporate a popular medical terminology standard called the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We provide a curated list of electronic and population healthcare data sources and open access datasets as a resource for potential researchers, in order to address one of the main challenges in this field. We classify the literature based on multidisciplinary research themes stemming from reoccurring topics. The survey provides a valuable overview of EHR Vis revealing both mature areas and potential future multidisciplinary research directions.},

   abstract = {The advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) motivates the deployment in various domains, including image classification, disease diagnoses, voice recognition, etc. Since some tasks that DNN undertakes are very sensitive, the label information is confidential and contains a commercial value or critical privacy. This paper demonstrates that DNNs also bring a new security threat, leading to the leakage of label information of input instances for the DNN models. In particular, we leverage the cache-based side-channel attack (SCA), i.e., Flush+Reload on the DNN (victim) models, to observe the execution of computation graphs, and create a database of them for building a classifier that the attacker can use to decide the label information of (unknown) input instances for victim models. Then we deploy the cache-based SCA on the same host machine with victim models and deduce the labels with the attacker's classification model to compromise the privacy and confidentiality of victim models. We explore different settings and classification techniques to achieve a high attack success rate of stealing label information from the victim models. Additionally, we consider two attacking scenarios: binary attacking identifies specific sensitive labels and others while multi-class attacking targets recognize all classes victim DNNs provide. Last, we implement the attack on both static DNN models with identical architectures for all inputs and dynamic DNN models with an adaptation of architectures for different inputs to demonstrate the vast existence of the proposed attack, including DenseNet 121, DenseNet 169, VGG 16, VGG 19, MobileNet v1, and MobileNet v2. Our experiment exhibits that MobileNet v1 is the most vulnerable one with 99% and 75.6% attacking success rates for binary and multi-class attacking scenarios, respectively.},

   abstract = {Localizing the source of graph diffusion phenomena, such as misinformation propagation, is an important yet extremely challenging task in the real world. Existing source localization models typically are heavily dependent on the hand-crafted rules and only tailored for certain domain-specific applications. Unfortunately, a large portion of the graph diffusion process for many applications is still unknown to human beings so it is important to have expressive models for learning such underlying rules automatically. Recently, there is a surge of research body on expressive models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for automatically learning the underlying graph diffusion. However, source localization is instead the inverse of graph diffusion, which is a typical inverse problem in graphs that is well-known to be ill-posed because there can be multiple solutions and hence different from the traditional (semi-)supervised learning settings. This paper aims to establish a generic framework of invertible graph diffusion models for source localization on graphs, namely Invertible Validity-aware Graph Diffusion (IVGD), to handle major challenges including 1) Difficulty to leverage knowledge in graph diffusion models for modeling their inverse processes in an end-to-end fashion, 2) Difficulty to ensure the validity of the inferred sources, and 3) Efficiency and scalability in source inference. Specifically, first, to inversely infer sources of graph diffusion, we propose a graph residual scenario to make existing graph diffusion models invertible with theoretical guarantees; second, we develop a novel error compensation mechanism that learns to offset the errors of the inferred sources. Finally, to ensure the validity of the inferred sources, a new set of validity-aware layers have been devised to project inferred sources to feasible regions by flexibly encoding constraints with unrolled optimization techniques. A linearization technique is proposed to strengthen the efficiency of our proposed layers. The convergence of the proposed IVGD is proven theoretically. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed IVGD outperforms state-of-the-art comparison methods significantly. We have released our code at https://github.com/xianggebenben/IVGD.},

   abstract = {Adapting speaker recognition systems to new environments is a widely-used technique to improve a well-performing model learned from large-scale data towards a task-specific small-scale data scenarios. However, previous studies focus on single domain adaptation, which neglects a more practical scenario where training data are collected from multiple acoustic domains needed in forensic scenarios. Audio analysis for forensic speaker recognition offers unique challenges in model training with multi-domain training data due to location/scenario uncertainty and diversity mismatch between reference and naturalistic field recordings. It is also difficult to directly employ small-scale domain-specific data to train complex neural network architectures due to domain mismatch and performance loss. Fine-tuning is a commonly-used method for adaptation in order to retrain the model with weights initialized from a well-trained model. Alternatively, in this study, three novel adaptation methods based on domain adversarial training, discrepancy minimization, and moment-matching approaches are proposed to further promote adaptation performance across multiple acoustic domains. A comprehensive set of experiments are conducted to demonstrate that: 1) diverse acoustic environments do impact speaker recognition performance, which could advance research in audio forensics, 2) domain adversarial training learns the discriminative features which are also invariant to shifts between domains, 3) discrepancy-minimizing adaptation achieves effective performance simultaneously across multiple acoustic domains, and 4) moment-matching adaptation along with dynamic distribution alignment also significantly promotes speaker recognition performance on each domain, especially for the LENA-field domain with noise compared to all other systems. Advancements shown here in adaptation therefore helper ensure more consistent performance for field operational data in audio forensics.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia is the top communicable cause of death worldwide. Accurate prognostication of patient severity with Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) allows better patient care and hospital management. The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) was developed in 1997 as a tool to guide clinical practice by stratifying the severity of patients with CAP. While the PSI has been evaluated against other clinical stratification tools, it has not been evaluated against multiple classic machine learning classifiers in various metrics over large sample size. METHODS: In this paper, we evaluated and compared the prediction performance of nine classic machine learning classifiers with PSI over 34,720 adult (age 18+) patient records collected from 749 hospitals from 2009 to 2018 in the United States on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Average Precision (Precision-Recall AUC). RESULTS: Machine learning classifiers, such as Random Forest, provided a statistically highly(p < 0.001) significant improvement (∼33% in PR AUC and ∼6% in ROC AUC) compared to PSI and required only 7 input values (compared to 20 parameters used in PSI). DISCUSSION: Because of its ease of use, PSI remains a very strong clinical decision tool, but machine learning classifiers can provide better prediction accuracy performance. Comparing prediction performance across multiple metrics such as PR AUC, instead of ROC AUC alone can provide additional insight.},

   abstract = {Oil is an important strategic material and energy for civil use. Accurate prediction of oil consumption can provide basis for relevant departments to reasonably arrange crude oil production, oil import and export, and optimize the allocation of social resources. Therefore, a new grey model FENBGM(1,1) is proposed to predict oil consumption in China. Firstly, the grey effect of the traditional GM(1,1) model was transformed into a quadratic equation. Four different parameters were introduced to improve the accuracy of the model, and the new initial conditions were designed by optimizing the initial values by weighted buffer operator. Combined with the reprocessing of the original data, the scheme eliminates the random disturbance effect, improves the stability of the system sequence, and can effectively extract the potential pattern of future development. Secondly, the cumulative order of the new model is optimized by fractional cumulative generation operation. At the same time, the smoothness rate quasi-smoothness condition was introduced to verify the stability of the model, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) was used to search the optimal parameters of the model to enhance the adaptability of the model. Based on the above improvements, the new combination prediction model overcomes the limitation of the traditional grey model and obtains more accurate and robust prediction results. Then, taking the petroleum consumption of China's manufacturing industry and transportation, storage and postal industry as an example, this paper verifies the validity of FENBGM(1,1) model, analyzes and forecasts China's crude oil consumption with several commonly used forecasting models, and uses FENBGM(1,1) model to forecast China's oil consumption in the next four years. The results show that FENBGM(1,1) model performs best in all cases. Finally, based on the prediction results of FENBGM(1,1) model, some reasonable suggestions are put forward for China's oil consumption planning.},

Here we focus on viral glycoprotein S, the target for neutralizing antibodies, and provide an in-depth analysis of its antigenic structure. Neutralizing antibodies are directed to the sialoglycan-receptor binding site in S1 A domain, but, remarkably, also to S1 B . The latter block infection yet do not prevent sialoglycan binding. While two distinct neutralizing S1 B epitopes are readily accessible in the prefusion S trimer, other sites are occluded such that their accessibility must be subject to conformational changes in S during cell-entry. While non-neutralizing antibodies were broadly reactive against a collection of natural OC43 variants, neutralizing antibodies generally displayed restricted binding breadth. Our data provide a structure-based understanding of protective immunity and adaptive evolution for this endemic coronavirus which emerged in humans long before SARS-CoV-2.},

   abstract = {We study risk hedging in the online procurement problem, where one buyer and one seller sign reservation contracts in advance to hedge against the risks from the uncertainties of real demand and spot price. We generalize the traditional two-stage procurement model such that the buyer has the flexibility of signing multiple contracts in the first stage and makes decision on executions in the second stage. A lower bound on the performance of any deterministic algorithms is presented by restricting the possible execution price sequence and real demand in worst case. Then a deterministic online algorithm called Price Look Back (PLB) is designed with a competitive ratio that tends to the lower bound if historical execution prices are less fluctuant. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-life instances to evaluate the practical performance of PLB. The experimental results show that PLB performs significantly better than its (worst-case) theoretical guarantee in most instances. In addition, PLB is robust with respect to inaccurate information learned from the historical data. Specifically, the average extra cost incurred by the inaccurate information can be around 5% in real-life instances.},

   abstract = {Identifying and optimizing open participation is essential to the success of open software development. Existing studies highlighted the importance of worker recommendation for crowdtesting tasks in order to improve bug detection efficiency, i.e., detect more bugs with fewer workers. However, there are a couple of limitations in existing work. First, these studies mainly focus on one-time recommendations based on expertise matching at the beginning of a new task. Second, the recommendation results suffer from severe popularity bias, i.e., highly experienced workers are recommended in almost all the tasks, while less experienced workers rarely get recommended. This article argues the need for context- and fairness-aware in-process crowdworker recommendation in order to address these limitations. We motivate this study through a pilot study, revealing the prevalence of long-sized non-yielding windows, i.e., no new bugs are revealed in consecutive test reports during the process of a crowdtesting task. This indicates the potential opportunity for accelerating crowdtesting by recommending appropriate workers in a dynamic manner, so that the non-yielding windows could be shortened. Besides, motivated by the popularity bias in existing crowdworker recommendation approach, this study also aims at alleviating the unfairness in recommendations.Driven by these observations, this article proposes a context- and fairness-aware in-process crowdworker recommendation approach, iRec2.0, to detect more bugs earlier, shorten the non-yielding windows, and alleviate the unfairness in recommendations. It consists of three main components: (1) the modeling of dynamic testing context, (2) the learning-based ranking component, and (3) the multi-objective optimization-based re-ranking component. The evaluation is conducted on 636 crowdtesting tasks from one of the largest crowdtesting platforms, and results show the potential of iRec2.0 in improving the cost-effectiveness of crowdtesting by saving the cost, shortening the testing process, and alleviating the unfairness among workers. In detail, iRec2.0 could shorten the non-yielding window by a median of 50%–66% in different application scenarios, and consequently have potential of saving testing cost by a median of 8%–12%. Meanwhile, the recommendation frequency of the crowdworker drop from 34%–60% to 5%–26% under different scenarios, indicating its potential in alleviating the unfairness among crowdworkers.},

The commonly used Caprini model is limited by its inadequate ability to discriminate between risk stratums on the surgical population in southwest China and lengthy risk factors. The purpose of this study was to establish an improved VTE risk assessment model that is accurate and simple. Methods: This study is based on the clinical data from 81,505 surgical patients hospitalized in the Southwest Hospital of China between January 1, 2019 and June 18, 2021. Among the population, 559 patients developed VTE. An improved VTE risk assessment model, SW-model, was established through Logistic Regression, with comparisons to both Caprini and Random Forest. Results: The SW-model incorporated eight risk factors. The area under the curve (AUC) of SW-model (0.807 [0.758, 0.853], 0.804 [0.765, 0.840]), are significantly superior (p = 0.001 and p = 0.044) to those of the Caprini (0.705 [0.652, 0.757], 0.758 [0.719, 0795]) on two test sets, but inferior (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002) to Random Forest (0.854 [0.814, 0.890], 0.839 [0.806, 0.868]). In decision curve analysis, within threshold range from 0.015 to 0.04, the DCA curves of the SW-model are superior to Caprini and two default strategies. Conclusions: The SW-model demonstrated a higher discriminative capability to distinguish VTE positive in surgical patients compared with the Caprini model. Compared to Random Forest, Logistic Regression based SW-model provided interpretability which is essential in guarantee the procedure of risk assessment transparent to clinicians.},

   abstract = {Public health emergency decisions are explored to ensure the emergency response measures in an environment where various emergencies occur frequently. An emergency decision is essentially a multi-criteria risk decision-making problem. The feasibility of applying prospect theory to emergency decisions is analyzed, and how psychological behaviors of decision-makers impact decision-making results are quantified. On this basis, the cognitive process of public health emergencies is investigated based on the rough set theory. A Decision Rule Extraction Algorithm (denoted as A-DRE) that considers attribute costs is proposed, which is then applied for attribute reduction and rule extraction on emergency datasets. In this way, decision-makers can obtain reduced decision table attributes quickly. Considering that emergency decisions require the participation of multiple departments, a framework is constructed to solve multi-department emergency decisions. The technical characteristics of the blockchain are in line with the requirements of decentralization and multi-party participation in emergency management. The core framework of the public health emergency management system-plan, legal system, mechanism, and system can play an important role. When δ= 0.10 , the classification accuracy under the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier reaches 73.5%. When δ= 0.15 , the classification accuracy under the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier reaches 86.4%. It can effectively improve China’s public health emergency management system and improve the efficiency of emergency management. By taking Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an example, the weight and prospect value functions of different decision-maker attributes are constructed based on prospect theory. The optimal rescue plan is finally determined. A-DRE can consider the cost of each attribute in the decision table and the ability to classify it correctly; moreover, it can reduce the attributes and extract the rules on the COVID-19 dataset, suitable for decision-makers' situation face once an emergency occurs. The emergency decision approach based on rough set attribute reduction and prospect theory can acquire practical decision-making rules while considering the different risk preferences of decision-makers facing different decision-making results, which is significant for the rapid development of public health emergency assistance and disaster relief.},

Using the image gradient parametrization as a regular term, the filtering restoration process is constrained and the fuzzy kernel is estimated to solve the degradation problem existing in the Tibetan antiquarian literature. In the algorithmic framework of nonlocal mean filtering, the calculation of the weight function is improved to reduce the computational effort. In the simulation results, it is shown that the improved nonlocal mean filtering restoration algorithm in this paper has good overall quality evaluation performance in the restoration of text-based images. The structural similarity between the generated image and the real image is guaranteed, and the internal mixed-mode learning of a single SAR image is performed by combining the pyramidal hierarchical network structure to improve the effectiveness of the generated image in general. The method further improves the similarity between the generated and real images, while improving the accuracy of the classification based on the data expanded by the generation method. The feasibility and accuracy of the online algorithm for the parameter estimation problem of the model are illustrated through numerical experiments with two specific examples of hidden Markov models, namely, a double Gaussian mixture model and a finite-state Markov chain model with Gaussian noise. At the same time, the advantages of the algorithm proposed in this paper are demonstrated by comparing the experimental results of the online EM algorithm with those of the offline EM algorithm on a unified model. Finally, the empirical analysis is used to illustrate the application of the algorithm in practical scenarios.},

   abstract = {Retail sectors consisting of hypermarkets, supermarkets, and convenience stores are closely related to the economy condition of a country because they satisfy basic requirements in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. These sectors sell substitutive product categories and mutually compete in customer groups. For instance, hypermarkets and supermarkets sell fresh vegetables, meat, fishes, and household supplies. Supermarkets and convenience stores sell drinks, snacks, bread, etc. To reveal managerial insights, this study presents a novel framework to achieve the following goals: (1) influential economic indicators and associated time lags are identified as effective predictors, (2) machine learning and deep learning are adopted to conduct sales forecasting, and (3) dynamic interactions between retail sectors and between competing firms are incorporated to estimate sales equilibriums. Experimental results show that consumer price index, retail employment population, and real wage concurrently affect sales revenues of the three retail sectors while seasonal factors are only critical to hypermarkets. Deep learning performs better and demonstrates good generalization without overfitting. Supermarkets and convenience stores suffer from the existence of hypermarkets and supermarkets are expected to decline 16% sales at equilibriums.},

Both supervised machine learning and time series analysis were employed to analyze 350,059 Weibo posts released by 3,883 news sources between December 2019 and April 2020. Our results indicated that, in this nonwestern state-regulated China media environment, official and semi-privatized commercial media had a significant reciprocal relationship in news coverage. Both of them focused on “treatment on patients,” “work resumption,” and “propaganda and mobilization.” Importantly, this paper sheds light on the value of the fine-grained level of agenda in IAS research. Using a fine-grained analysis, we separately investigated the effects of official and semi-privatized commercial media on predicting the pandemic prevalence, referring to the number of confirmed cases reported in real time. Implications and future directions were further discussed.},

   abstract = {Despite the long history of studying instant messaging usage, we know very little about how today's people participate in group chat channels and interact with others inside a real-world organization. In this short paper, we aim to update the existing knowledge on how group chat is used in the context of today's organizations. The knowledge is particularly important for the new norm of remote works under the COVID-19 pandemic. We have the privilege of collecting two valuable datasets: a total of 4,300 group chat channels in Slack from an R&amp;D department in a multinational IT company; and a total of 117 groups' performance data. Through qualitative coding of 100 randomly sampled group channels from the 4,300 channels dataset, we identified and reported 9 categories such as Project channels, IT-Support channels, and Event channels. We further defined a feature metric with 21 meta-features (and their derived features) without looking at the message content to depict the group communication style for these group chat channels, with which we successfully trained a machine learning model that can automatically classify a given group channel into one of the 9 categories. In addition to the descriptive data analysis, we illustrated how these communication metrics can be used to analyze team performance. We cross-referenced 117 project teams and their team-based Slack channels and identified 57 teams that appeared in both datasets, then we built a regression model to reveal the relationship between these group communication styles and the project team performance. This work contributes an updated empirical understanding of human-human communication practices within the enterprise setting, and suggests design opportunities for the future of human-AI communication experience.},

   abstract = {Session-based recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both industry and academic communities. Previous models mostly focus on designing different models to fit the observed data, which can be quite sparse in real-world scenarios. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel generative session-based recommendation framework. The main building block of our idea is to develop a generator to simulate user sequential behaviors, which are leveraged to train and improve the target sequential recommender model. In order to generate high quality samples, we consider two aspects: (1) the rationality as a sequence of user behaviors, and (2) the informativeness for training the target model. To satisfy these requirements, we design a doubly adversarial network. The first adversarial module aims to make the generated samples conform to the underlying patterns of the real user sequential preference (rationality requirement). The second adversarial module is targeted at widening the model experiences by generating samples which can induce larger model losses (informativeness requirement). In our model, the samples are generated based on a reinforcement learning strategy, where the reward is related with both of the above aspects. In order to stable the training process, we introduce a self-paced regularizer to learn the agent in an easy-to-hard manner. We conduct extensive experiments based on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

   abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a practice of using collective intelligence of a group in order to achieve a common goal to solve complex problems in an innovative way. It involves obtaining information and opinions from a group of participants who submit their data (i.e., solutions) via the Internet using some applications. The application domains, where crowdsourcing can be used, include, but not limited to, healthcare, environment, public safety, disaster management, and transportation. Despite the unprecedented advantages of crowdsourcing, security and privacy are rising concerns that need to be addressed. Therefore, it is crucially important to provide effective solutions that address the security and privacy issues in crowdsourcing systems. To this end, the salient features of blockchain technology such as immutability, decentralization, transparency and resiliency can play a pivotal role to address the afore-mentioned security challenges. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose a new blockchain-based user authentication and key agreement scheme for crowdsourcing (BUAKA-CS) through lightweight cryptographic techniques. The security of the BUAKA-CS is proved through the formal method and also through other mathematical methods that depict the resilience of BUAKA-CS against various types of possible attacks. Moreover, the robustness of BUAKA-CS against possible attacks is proved through widely-recognized automated software validation tools. We also compare BUAKA-CS with other existing schemes and prove its out performance in terms of security, functionality, computation and communication costs. Finally, we conduct the extensive blockchain-based simulations to measure the impact of BUAKA-CS on the performance of the system.},

Effective strategies to cope with such unrelenting feelings of loneliness are needed. In times of COVID-19, we conducted a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study with 280 lonely participants in Germany over 7 months, where a long and hard second national lockdown was in place. Each participant reported their daily loneliness and coping strategies for loneliness once in the evening for 7 consecutive days. We found that managing emotions and social relationships were associated with decreased feelings of loneliness, while using a problem-focused coping strategy was associated with increased feelings of loneliness amid COVID-19. Interestingly, managing emotions was particularly effective for easing loneliness during the second lockdown. Females tend to use more emotion-focused coping strategies to overcome their loneliness compared to males. Our study highlights the importance of managing emotions against loneliness throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Designing technology that provides emotional support to people may be one of the keys to easing loneliness and promoting well-being.},

   abstract = {Occupants' behaviour and the use of electrical equipment can significantly impact the building energy demand. Accurate occupancy and equipment usage information are key to improving the performance of demand-driven control, which can automatically adjust the heating, cooling and ventilation system operation. Employing static schedules is commonly used for the operation of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, while it cannot satisfy the actual requirements due to the dynamic variations within the conditioned spaces. This study introduces a coupled real-time occupancy and equipment usage detection and recognition approach using deep learning and computer vision techniques for efficient building energy controls. The experimental results presented an overall equipment detection and occupancy activity detection accuracy of 78.39% and 93.60%. To investigate the influence of the implementation of the approach on building energy demand, a case study office building was selected to conduct experimental tests and modeled using a building energy simulation tool. Four scenarios with different occupancy and equipment profiles were defined and evaluated. The simulation results showed that heat gains, when employing static profiles were larger than the heat gains predicted when using the deep learning influenced profiles. Up to 53.95% lower heat gains were estimated when using both occupancy and equipment detection approaches than static schedules solely. The results highlighted the importance of monitoring real-time occupancy and electrical equipment usage and the advantages of using deep learning detection techniques to provide data for demand-driven controls, optimising building energy efficiency while maintaining a comfortable indoor environment.},

   abstract = {Background: Recent research suggests that autistic individuals have shorter lifespans and experience worse health (greater health burden) than non-autistic individuals. Small, qualitative studies suggest that autistic adults also experience poor self-reported healthcare quality. Method(s): An anonymized, cross-sectional, self-report questionnaire was administered to n = 4158 individuals. The study assessed prevalence of chronic health conditions, healthcare quality, differences in overall health inequality score, and effects of the coronavirus pandemic on healthcare quality. We used Fisher's exact tests, binomial logistic regression, and predictive machine learning tools, as appropriate. Result(s): The final sample included n = 2649 participants (n = 1285 autistic) aged 16-96 years. Autistic adults reported lower quality healthcare than non-autistic adults across 50/51 items, including poorer access to healthcare and poorer communication, alongside increased anxiety, sensory sensitivity, system-level problems, shutdowns, and meltdowns. Differences between groups were stark: aggregated health inequality scores predicted autism diagnosis, even after stratifying by sex. Autistic adults were also more likely to have chronic health conditions than non-autistic adults. There were no significant differences in healthcare quality for autistic adults before and during the pandemic, although they received relatively poorer quality healthcare than non-autistic adults across both periods. Limitation(s): The study's sampling methods are not likely to capture the perspectives of all autistic individuals, especially those with intellectual disability. Both the autistic and control samples are biased towards UK residents, white individuals, those assigned female at birth, and those who completed an undergraduate degree or higher education. As such, these results may limit their generalizability to other groups. Finally, these results relate to self-reported differences in healthcare quality between autistic and non-autistic adults. The observed group differences may in part reflect differences in perception and communication rather than differences in actual healthcare quality. Conclusion(s): Autistic adults are more likely to have chronic health conditions alongside self-reported lower quality healthcare than others. Health inequalities between these groups are widespread and dramatic; unfortunately, they existed before and have persisted after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

Here, we utilize high-density traffic monitoring data and land use data to train random forest models capable of accurately predicting dynamic, link-level vehicle emissions. A total of 272 predicting indicators, including road features, population density, and land use information, were included in model training. Our model performed well, with a spatial generalization R2 > 0.8 for both volume and speed simulations. Dynamic link-based emissions of major air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2) were estimated for the whole road network of Chengdu, a populous city with the second greatest vehicle population in China. We adopted a generalized additive model to identify the drivers of spatial heterogeneity of on-road emissions and energy consumption, and nonlinear relationships between emissions, demographic and land use variables were found. Fine-grained assessments of emission reductions from potential Low Emission Zone policies are explored based on the high-resolution vehicle emission mapping tool. With high computational efficiency, the method is promising for handling traffic data streams in a real-time fashion, thus offering the potential for more precise vehicle emission management and carbon footprint tracking.},

Practices of making futures are increasingly online. Yet, as organizational participants come together online – organizing remotely to make offline futures – they lack the shared experiential knowledge that is gained through embodied and situated practices. In this essay, we argue that the lack of experiential knowledge makes future making online difficult to organize and vulnerable to excluding relevant expertise; dialogue may become inward-looking and self-referential within the online environment, with an emotional and cognitive distance from the futures being made outside of such representations. We draw on the pragmatist tradition to theorize online future making, to articulate its dynamics and the challenges that arise, and to suggest remedial actions. By conceptualizing future making as a form of inquiry – as a distributed and reflective process that proceeds through engagement with representations of the future – we identify three remedial actions for online future making: to solicit feedback, juxtapose alternatives and change medium. These remedial actions seek to compensate for the lack of shared experiential knowledge by both sustaining the online involvement of heterogeneous remote participants and by bringing in relevant (offline) places, people and materials to online future making.},

   abstract = {Background: Specialized evidence-based treatments have been developed and evaluated for borderline personality disorder (BPD), including Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Schema Therapy (ST). Individual differences in treatment response to both ST and DBT have been observed across studies, but the factors driving these differences are largely unknown. Understanding which treatment works best for whom and why remain central issues in psychotherapy research. The aim of the present study is to improve treatment response of DBT and ST for BPD patients by a) identifying patient characteristics that predict (differential) treatment response (i.e., treatment selection) and b) understanding how both treatments lead to change (i.e., mechanisms of change). Moreover, the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of DBT and ST will be evaluated. Methods: The BOOTS trial is a multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted in a routine clinical setting in several outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. We aim to recruit 200 participants, to be randomized to DBT or ST. Patients receive a combined program of individual and group sessions for a maximum duration of 25 months. Data are collected at baseline until three-year follow-up. Candidate predictors of (differential) treatment response have been selected based on the literature, a patient representative of the Borderline Foundation of the Netherlands, and semi-structured interviews among 18 expert clinicians. In addition, BPD-treatment-specific (ST: beliefs and schema modes; DBT: emotion regulation and skills use), BPD-treatment-generic (therapeutic environment characterized by genuineness, safety, and equality), and non-specific (attachment and therapeutic alliance) mechanisms of change are assessed. The primary outcome measure is change in BPD manifestations. Secondary outcome measures include functioning, additional self-reported symptoms, and well-being. Discussion: The current study contributes to the optimization of treatments for BPD patients by extending our knowledge on “Which treatment – DBT or ST – works the best for which BPD patient, and why?”, which is likely to yield important benefits for both BPD patients (e.g., prevention of overtreatment and potential harm of treatments) and society (e.g., increased economic productivity of patients and efficient use of treatments).

   abstract = {Importance: Understanding the differences and potential synergies between traditional clinician assessment and automated machine learning might enable more accurate and useful suicide risk detection. Objective: To evaluate the respective and combined abilities of a real-time machine learning model and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) to predict suicide attempt (SA) and suicidal ideation (SI). Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included encounters with adult patients (aged ≥18 years) at a major academic medical center. The C-SSRS was administered during routine care, and a Vanderbilt Suicide Attempt and Ideation Likelihood (VSAIL) prediction was generated in the electronic health record. Encounters took place in the inpatient, ambulatory surgical, and emergency department settings. Data were collected from June 2019 to September 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were the incidence of SA and SI, encoded as International Classification of Diseases codes, occurring within various time periods after an index visit. We evaluated the retrospective validity of the C-SSRS, VSAIL, and ensemble models combining both. Discrimination metrics included area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results: The cohort included 120398 unique index visits for 83394 patients (mean [SD] age, 51.2 [20.6] years; 38107 [46%] men; 45273 [54%] women; 13644 [16%] Black; 63869 [77%] White). Within 30 days of an index visit, the combined models had higher AUROC (SA: 0.874-0.887; SI: 0.869-0.879) than both the VSAIL (SA: 0.729; SI: 0.773) and C-SSRS (SA: 0.823; SI: 0.777) models. In the highest risk-decile, ensemble methods had PPV of 1.3% to 1.4% for SA and 8.3% to 8.7% for SI and sensitivity of 77.6% to 79.5% for SA and 67.4% to 70.1% for SI, outperforming VSAIL (PPV for SA: 0.4%; PPV for SI: 3.9%; sensitivity for SA: 28.8%; sensitivity for SI: 35.1%) and C-SSRS (PPV for SA: 0.5%; PPV for SI: 3.5%; sensitivity for SA: 76.6%; sensitivity for SI: 68.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, suicide risk prediction was optimal when leveraging both in-person screening (for acute measures of risk in patient-reported suicidality) and historical EHR data (for underlying clinical factors that can quantify a patient's passive risk level). To improve suicide risk classification, prediction systems could combine pretrained machine learning with structured clinician assessment without needing to retrain the original model..},

   abstract = {Increasing availability of electronic health databases capturing real-world experiences with medical products has garnered much interest in their use for pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacovigilance studies. The traditional practice of having numerous groups use single databases to accomplish similar tasks and address common questions about medical products can be made more efficient through well-coordinated multi-database studies, greatly facilitated through distributed data network (DDN) architectures. Access to larger amounts of electronic health data within DDNs has created a growing interest in using data-adaptive machine learning (ML) techniques that can automatically model complex associations in high-dimensional data with minimal human guidance. However, the siloed storage and diverse nature of the databases in DDNs create unique challenges for using ML. In this paper, we discuss opportunities, challenges, and considerations for applying ML in DDNs for pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacovigilance studies. We first discuss major types of activities performed by DDNs and how ML may be used. Next, we discuss practical data-related factors influencing how DDNs work in practice. We then combine these discussions and jointly consider how opportunities for ML are affected by practical data-related factors for DDNs, leading to several challenges. We present different approaches for addressing these challenges and highlight efforts that real-world DDNs have taken or are currently taking to help mitigate them. Despite these challenges, the time is ripe for the emerging interest to use ML in DDNs, and the utility of these data-adaptive modeling techniques in pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacovigilance studies will likely continue to increase in the coming years.},

   abstract = {The growing demand for head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, along with a global shortage of radiologists, has led to an increase in the time taken to report head MRI scans in recent years. For many neurological conditions, this delay can result in poorer patient outcomes and inflated healthcare costs. Potentially, computer vision models could help reduce reporting times for abnormal examinations by flagging abnormalities at the time of imaging, allowing radiology departments to prioritise limited resources into reporting these scans first. To date, however, the difficulty of obtaining large, clinically-representative labelled datasets has been a bottleneck to model development. In this work, we present a deep learning framework, based on convolutional neural networks, for detecting clinically-relevant abnormalities in minimally processed, hospital-grade axial T2-weighted and axial diffusion-weighted head MRI scans. The models were trained at scale using a Transformer-based neuroradiology report classifier to generate a labelled dataset of 70,206 examinations from two large UK hospital networks, and demonstrate fast (< 5 s), accurate (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) > 0.9), and interpretable classification, with good generalisability between hospitals (ΔAUC ≤ 0.02). Through a simulation study we show that our best model would reduce the mean reporting time for abnormal examinations from 28 days to 14 days and from 9 days to 5 days at the two hospital networks, demonstrating feasibility for use in a clinical triage environment.},

Empirically, four Macau luxury hotels are selected and their customer reviews are crawled from two popular online platforms. A deep learning method, the Long Short-Term Memory model, is used to extract sentiment information from consumer reviews. Three sentiment indices, namely, bullish index, average index and variance index, are constructed and examined. The effectiveness of these sentiment indices is further evaluated by the autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables model. Empirical results indicate that the inclusion of the sentiment indices helps with improving forecast accuracy. The findings of this study further emphasise the importance of textual content to hotel practitioners in terms of strategy formulation, revenue management and competitiveness enhancement.},

   abstract = {Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models are well-suited for solving portfolio selection problems. Diversified financial indices and complex subjective preferences are important factors affecting investment decisions within the MCDM framework. Therefore, this study adopts a well-known behavioral MCDM model called generalized TODIM (TOmada de Decisão Iterativa Multicritério) for portfolio selection based on the financial performance of firms. First, a multidimensional financial evaluation index system is proposed for financial performance evaluation, which is the most appropriate approach for stock investment within a long-term horizon. Second, features are selected from the financial ratios using affinity propagation clustering (APC). Through the APC algorithm, financial ratios with a strong influence on stock evaluation can be obtained. Third, a generalized TODIM method with entropy weight is used to calculate the dominance relation between stocks and reflect investors’ bounded rational behaviors. Fourth, an extended mean–variance multi-objective portfolio selection model that considers financial and stock market performance is constructed. The compromise solution is used when solving the multi-objective optimization programming. Finally, a case study on medical stock investment in the Chinese stock market is examined to recommend the optimal portfolio allocation for investors. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are performed to demonstrate the robustness, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed methodology.},

A machine learning model was built to estimate the effectiveness of interventions and simulate transmission in different scenarios. The comparison was conducted between simulated and real cases in Xiamen. A web interface with adjustable parameters, including choice of intervention measures, intervention weights, vaccination, and viral variants, was designed for users to run the simulation. The total case number was set as the outcome. The cumulative number was 4,614,641 without restrictions and 78 under the strictest intervention set. Simulation with the parameters closest to the real situation of the Xiamen outbreak was performed to verify the accuracy and reliability of the model. The simulation model generated a duration of 52 days before the daily cases dropped to zero and the final cumulative case number of 200, which were 25 more days and 36 fewer cases than the real situation, respectively.

   abstract = {Background: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, and subsequent cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are becoming the most common etiology for liver failure and liver transplantation; however, they can only be diagnosed at these potentially reversible stages with a liver biopsy, which is associated with various complications and high expenses. Knowing the difference between the more benign isolated steatosis and the more severe NASH and cirrhosis informs the physician regarding the need for more aggressive management. Objective: We intend to explore the feasibility of using machine learning methods for noninvasive diagnosis of NASH and advanced liver fibrosis and compare machine learning methods with existing quantitative risk scores. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from a cohort of 492 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), NASH, or advanced fibrosis. We systematically compared 5 widely used machine learning algorithms for the prediction of NAFLD, NASH, and fibrosis using 2 variable encoding strategies. Then, we compared the machine learning methods with 3 existing quantitative scores and identified the important features for prediction using the SHapley Additive exPlanations method. Results: The best machine learning method, gradient boosting (GB), achieved the best area under the curve scores of 0.9043, 0.8166, and 0.8360 for NAFLD, NASH, and advanced fibrosis, respectively. GB also outperformed 3 existing risk scores for fibrosis. Among the variables, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride (TG), and BMI were the important risk factors for the prediction of NAFLD, whereas aspartate transaminase (AST), ALT, and TG were the important variables for the prediction of NASH, and AST, hyperglycemia (A1c), and high-density lipoprotein were the important variables for predicting advanced fibrosis. Conclusions: It is feasible to use machine learning methods for predicting NAFLD, NASH, and advanced fibrosis using routine clinical data, which potentially can be used to better identify patients who still need liver biopsy. Additionally, understanding the relative importance and differences in predictors could lead to improved understanding of the disease process as well as support for identifying novel treatment options.},

   abstract = {The rise of big data brings extraordinary benefits and opportunities to businesses and governments. Enterprise users can analyze their consumers’ data and infer the business value, such as purchasing goods correlations and customer preferences. To unveil such hidden values from big data, various big data processing frameworks, such as Hadoop and Tensor-flow, are developed. One fundamental approach of accelerating such big data processing frameworks is to efficiently evaluate queries for big data analytics based on materialization of intermediate results. In this paper, we consider problems of dynamic and proactive QoS-aware query evaluation of big data analytics with intermediate result materialization in a mobile edge cloud. We propose a one-shot online algorithm for the dynamic QoS-aware big data query evaluation within a finite time horizon, which can intelligently determine whether some immediate results during query evaluation need to be materialized for later use of other queries, by making use of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) method with predictions. We also devise an online learning algorithm based on the technique of multi-armed bandits, for the proactive QoS-aware big data query evaluation problem with resource reservations, where the query arrival information and their required datasets are uncertain before the actual evaluation of the queries. We finally investigate the performance of the proposed algorithms by experimental simulations, and results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms is promising, by achieving 12% higher system throughput while reducing 50% and 40% average evaluation cost and time per query compared to the comparison benchmarks.},

   abstract = {With the rapid progress of urbanization and continuous increasing of automobiles, expressway on- and off-ramp area becomes the bottleneck, and recurrent congestion occurs frequently. In order to solve the problem of traffic jam caused around off-ramps, various methods have been employed. Among all, mainline variable speed limit (VSL) control accounts for some proportion. In this study, mainline VSL adjustment of off-ramp upstream is investigated with the reinforcement learning algorithm under the connected vehicles environment to alleviate the traffic congestion. First, the assumptions are made to be suitable for the traffic conditions of mainline VSL control on off-ramp upstream, and then VSL algorithm based on reinforcement learning is presented, and Q-learning is chosen as the main algorithm. Next, the state space, action space, and reward function required by Q-learning are constructed orderly, and the related parameters are labelled. After that, according to the platform based on Python and VISSIM, three schemes, free control (Scheme 0), mainline VSL adjustment of off-ramp upstream based on rule (Scheme 1), and mainline VSL adjustment of off-ramp upstream based on Q-learning algorithm (Scheme 2), are designed, and the three schemes are simulated and compared quantitatively to reflect the off-ramp travel efficiency. The results indicate that mainline dynamic VSL adjustment of off-ramp upstream based on Q-learning algorithm performs the best in terms of general and specific indexes. The results provide potential insights for relieving the traffic congestion and traffic flow control under CAVs environment.},

   abstract = {Infectious virus outbreaks pose a significant challenge to public healthcare systems. Early and accurate virus diagnosis is critical to prevent the spread of the virus, especially when no specific vaccine or effective medicine is available. In clinics, the most commonly used viral detection methods are molecular techniques that involve the measurement of nucleic acids or proteins biomarkers. However, most clinic-based methods require complex infrastructure and expensive equipment, which are not suitable for low-resource settings. Over the past years, smartphone-based point-of-care testing (POCT) has rapidly emerged as a potential alternative to laboratory-based clinical diagnosis. This review summarizes the latest development of virus detection. First, laboratory-based and POCT-based viral diagnostic techniques are compared, both of which rely on immunosensing and nucleic acid detection. Then, various smartphone-based POCT diagnostic techniques, including optical biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, and other types of biosensors are discussed. Moreover, this review covers the development of smartphone-based POCT diagnostics for various viruses including COVID-19, Ebola, influenza, Zika, HIV, et al. Finally, the prospects and challenges of smartphone-based POCT diagnostics are discussed. It is believed that this review will aid researchers better understand the current challenges and prospects for achieving the ultimate goal of containing disease-causing viruses worldwide.},

Based on frame theory, this study employed an experimental design to examine how two contrasting approaches of COVID-19 risk message framing (amplifying vs. attenuating) affected post-pandemic travel intention via the mediation of perceived safety and travel fear, and how resilience and impulsivity as tourist traits moderate these relationships. Survey results based on 481 responses revealed that: (1) risk messages significantly predicted tourists’ perceived safety, travel fear, and travel intention; (2) tourists’ perceived safety and travel fear mediated the effects of risk messages on travel intention; (3) while resilience moderated the effects of message framing on perceived safety and travel intention, impulsivity only moderated the effect of message framing on travel fear.

   abstract = {Background: Emergency readmission poses an additional burden on both patients and healthcare systems. Risk stratification is the first step of transitional care interventions targeted at reducing readmission. To accurately predict the short- and intermediate-term risks of readmission and provide information for further temporal risk stratification, we developed and validated an interpretable machine learning risk scoring system. Methods: In this retrospective study, all emergency admission episodes from January 1st 2009 to December 31st 2016 at a tertiary hospital in Singapore were assessed. The primary outcome was time to emergency readmission within 90 days post discharge. The Score for Emergency ReAdmission Prediction (SERAP) tool was derived via an interpretable machine learning-based system for time-to-event outcomes. SERAP is six-variable survival score, and takes the number of emergency admissions last year, age, history of malignancy, history of renal diseases, serum creatinine level, and serum albumin level during index admission into consideration. Findings: A total of 293,589 ED admission episodes were finally included in the whole cohort. Among them, 203,748 episodes were included in the training cohort, 50,937 episodes in the validation cohort, and 38,904 in the testing cohort. Readmission within 90 days was documented in 80,213 (27.3%) episodes, with a median time to emergency readmission of 22 days (Interquartile range: 8-47). For different time points, the readmission rates observed in the whole cohort were 6.7% at 7 days, 10.6% at 14 days, 13.6% at 21 days, 16.4% at 30 days, and 23.0% at 60 days. In the testing cohort, the SERAP achieved an integrated area under the curve of 0.737 (95% confidence interval: 0.730-0.743). For a specific 30-day readmission prediction, SERAP outperformed the LACE index (Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Charlson comorbidity index, and Emergency department visits in past six months) and the HOSPITAL score (Hemoglobin at discharge, discharge from an Oncology service, Sodium level at discharge, Procedure during the index admission, Index Type of admission, number of Admissions during the last 12 months, and Length of stay). Besides 30-day readmission, SERAP can predict readmission rates at any time point during the 90-day period. Interpretation: Better performance in risk prediction was achieved by the SERAP than other existing scores, and accurate information about time to emergency readmission was generated for further temporal risk stratification and clinical decision-making. In the future, external validation studies are needed to evaluate the SERAP at different settings and assess their real-world performance. Funding: This study was supported by the Singapore National Medical Research Council under the PULSES Center Grant, and Duke-NUS Medical School.},

The main objective is to automate the quality control of the hand hygiene process by recognizing handwashing actions. This paper proposes a new computer vision-based hand hygiene monitoring approach, with the aim to recognize handwashing actions from the input videos. The proposed approach consists of the following three modules. First, in the feature extraction module, a backbone convolutional neural network (CNN) model (i.e., a ResNet model) is used to extract features from each frame of the input video. Second, in the feature aggregation module, the self-attention mechanism is introduced to form six masked self-attention blocks that are stacked to aggregate features from multiple frames. Third, in the feature classification module, the self-attentive aggregated feature representation is used for handwashing action recognition. The proposed approach outperforms a few state-of-the-art handwashing action recognition approaches. The proposed approach is able to perform effective and accurate handwashing action recognition for automatic hand hygiene monitoring, as verified by three benchmark datasets.},

   abstract = {User-User interaction recommendation, or interaction recommendation, is an indispensable service in social platforms, where the system automatically predicts with whom a user wants to interact. In real-world social platforms, we observe that user interactions may occur in diverse scenarios, and new scenarios constantly emerge, such as new games or sales promotions. There are two challenges in these emerging scenarios: (1) The behavior of users on the emerging scenarios could be different from existing ones due to the diversity among scenarios; (2) Emerging scenarios may only have scarce user behavioral data for model learning. Towards these two challenges, we present KoMen, a Domain Knowledge Guided Meta-learning framework for Interaction Recommendation. KoMen first learns a set of global model parameters shared among all scenarios and then quickly adapts the parameters for an emerging scenario based on its similarities with the existing ones. There are two highlights of KoMen: (1) KoMen customizes global model parameters by incorporating domain knowledge of the scenarios (e.g., a taxonomy that organizes scenarios by their purposes and functions), which captures scenario inter-dependencies with very limited training. (2) KoMen learns the scenario-specific parameters through a mixture-of-expert architecture, which reduces model variance resulting from data scarcity while still achieving the expressiveness to handle diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KoMen achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public benchmark dataset and a large-scale real industry dataset. Remarkably, KoMen improves over the best baseline w.r.t. weighted ROC-AUC by 2.14% and 2.03% on the two datasets, respectively. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Veronicium/koMen.},

   abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, many students lost opportunities to explore science in labs due to school closures. Remote labs provide a possible solution to mitigate this loss. However, most remote labs to date are based on a somehow centralized model in which experts design and conduct certain types of experiments in well-equipped facilities, with a few options of manipulation provided to remote users. In this article, we propose a distributed framework, dubbed remote labs 2.0, that offers the flexibility needed to build an open platform to support educators to create, operate, and share their own remote labs. Similar to the transformation of the Web from 1.0 to 2.0, remote labs 2.0 can greatly enrich experimental science on the Internet by allowing users to choose and contribute their subjects and topics. As a reference implementation, we developed a platform branded as Telelab. In collaboration with a high school chemistry teacher, we conducted remote chemical reaction experiments on the Telelab platform with two online classes. Pre/posttest results showed that these high school students attained significant gains (<italic>t</italic>(26) = 8.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00001) in evidence-based reasoning abilities. Student surveys revealed the following three key affordances of Telelab: 1) live experiments; 2) scientific instruments; and 3) social interactions. All 31 respondents were engaged by one or more of these affordances. Students’ behaviors were characterized by analyzing their interaction data logged by the platform. These findings suggest that appropriate applications of remote labs 2.0 in distance education can, to some extent, reproduce critical effects of their local counterparts on promoting science learning.},

As vulnerable road users, pedestrians and bicyclists are more likely to be injured or killed in accidents involving cars. Therefore, understanding the perceptions of vulnerable road users is crucial for developing and deploying AVs and solving public concerns because the acceptance of AVs relies on both AV users and other road users, such as vulnerable road users. This paper analyzed two surveys collected in 2017 and 2019 by BikePGH in Pittsburgh to understand vulnerable road users’ perceptions of AVs in different years. The analysis showed that vulnerable road users’ interactive experiences with AVs increased from 2017 to 2019 in Pittsburgh, and the interactive experiences with AVs positively affected vulnerable road users’ perceived safety and receptivity toward AVs in 2017 and 2019. Specifically, vulnerable road users’ perceived safety of AVs significantly increased from 2017 to 2019, while their receptivity toward AVs did not change significantly during that period. Additionally, autonomous driving accidents negatively affected vulnerable road users’ perceptions of AVs. Therefore, we recommend that policymakers provide opportunities for the public to interact with AVs and guarantee vulnerable road users’ safety and benefits in AV testing.},

Traditional misinformation detection methods typically focus on centralized offline processing, that is, they process pandemic-related social data by deploying the model in a single local server. However, such processing incurs extremely long latency when detecting social misinformation related to COVID-19, and cannot handle large-scale social misinformation. In this paper, we propose COS2, a distributed and scalable system that supports large-scale COVID-19-related social misinformation detection.

   abstract = {Inspection by X-ray has a wide range of applicability in airports, subways, railway stations, bus stations, and shipping ports. However, using X-ray images during security inspections is challenging because the X-ray image containing prohibited items (positive samples) in the real-world security inspection scenario is much smaller than those that do not contain prohibited items (negative samples). This results in low detection efficiency of the auto security inspection and many false detections. Considering this problem, this paper proposes detecting and recognizing prohibited items on X-ray images in real-world security inspections based on multi-task learning (MTL). This method uses an image classification network to filter out most X-ray images that do not contain prohibited items, thus reducing false detections and improving detection efficiency. MTL simultaneously trains the image classification network and the detection network of prohibited items. In addition, the backbone of the MTL network adopts a model sharing method that can reduce model parameters and improve the convergence speed of the model. Based on a dataset of security inspection X-ray images where the ratio of negative samples to positive samples is 100 (SIXray100), we performed data augmentation, estimated the target anchor of the training set, and used the concept of multi-scale training to complete the model training. Compared with the class-balanced hierarchical refinement method (CHR) that proposed a benchmark in detection, our method shows an improvement of 2% to 5%. Moreover, as the number of test images increases, our approach will obtain results that significantly exceed those from previous research. At the same time, this paper’s strategy for detecting prohibited items and its shared neural network framework have significant application value in engineering.},

By learning a better graph as part of the input of the mining model, it is expected to benefit graph mining in a variety of settings, ranging from denoising, imputation to defense. We formulate the graph sanitation problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and further instantiate it by semi-supervised node classification, together with an effective solver named GaSoliNe. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is (1) broadly applicable with respect to various graph neural network models and flexible graph modification strategies, (2) effective in improving the node classification accuracy on both the original and contaminated graphs in various perturbation scenarios. In particular, it brings up to 25% performance improvement over the existing robust graph neural network methods.},

   abstract = {Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global pandemic which provokes massive devastation to the society, economy, and culture since January 2020. The pandemic demonstrates the inefficiency of superannuated manual detection approaches and inspires novel approaches that detect COVID-19 by classifying chest x-ray (CXR) images with deep learning technology. Although a wide range of researches about bran-new COVID-19 detection methods that classify CXR images with centralized convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been proposed, the latency, privacy, and cost of information transmission between the data resources and the centralized data center will make the detection inefficient. Hence, in this article, a COVID-19 detection scheme via CXR images classification with a lightweight CNN model called MobileNet in edge computing is proposed to alleviate the computing pressure of centralized data center and ameliorate detection efficiency. Specifically, the general framework is introduced first to manifest the overall arrangement of the computing and information services ecosystem. Then, an unsupervised model DCGAN is employed to make up for the small scale of data set. Moreover, the implementation of the MobileNet for CXR images classification is presented at great length. The specific distribution strategy of MobileNet models is followed. The extensive evaluations of the experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme for detecting COVID-19 over CXR images in edge computing.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proved to be a highly efficient tool for COVID-19 diagnosis, but the large data size and heavy label force required for algorithm development and the poor generalizability of AI algorithms, to some extent, limit the application of AI technology in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to develop an AI algorithm with high robustness using limited chest CT data for COVID-19 discrimination. Methods: A three dimensional algorithm that combined multi-instance learning with the LSTM architecture (3DMTM) was developed for differentiating COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) while logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and a three dimensional convolutional neural network set for comparison. Totally, 515 patients with or without COVID-19 between December 2019 and March 2020 from five different hospitals were recruited and divided into relatively large (150 COVID-19 and 183 CAP cases) and relatively small datasets (17 COVID-19 and 35 CAP cases) for either training or validation and another independent dataset (37 COVID-19 and 93 CAP cases) for external test. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, F1 score, and G-mean were utilized for performance evaluation. Results: In the external test cohort, the relatively large data-based 3DMTM-LD achieved an AUC of 0.956 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 0.929∼0.982) with 86.2% and 98.0% for its sensitivity and specificity. 3DMTM-SD got an AUC of 0.937 (95% CI, 0.909∼0.965), while the AUC of 3DCM-SD decreased dramatically to 0.714 (95% CI, 0.649∼0.780) with training data reduction. KNN-MMSD, LR-MMSD, SVM-MMSD, and 3DCM-MMSD benefited significantly from the inclusion of clinical information while models trained with relatively large dataset got slight performance improvement in COVID-19 discrimination. 3DMTM, trained with either CT or multi-modal data, presented comparably excellent performance in COVID-19 discrimination. Conclusions: The 3DMTM algorithm presented excellent robustness for COVID-19 discrimination with limited CT data. 3DMTM based on CT data performed comparably in COVID-19 discrimination with that trained with multi-modal information. Clinical information could improve the performance of KNN, LR, SVM, and 3DCM in COVID-19 discrimination, especially in the scenario with limited data for training.},

   abstract = {With rapid urbanization and increasing climate risks, enhancing the resilience of urban systems has never been more important. Despite the availability of massive datasets of human behavior (e.g., mobile phone data, satellite imagery), studies on disaster resilience have been limited to using static measures as proxies for resilience. However, static metrics have significant drawbacks such as their inability to capture the effects of compounding and accumulating disaster shocks; dynamic interdependencies of social, economic, and infrastructure systems; and critical transitions and regime shifts, which are essential components of the complex disaster resilience process. In this article, we argue that the disaster resilience literature needs to take the opportunities of big data and move toward a different research direction, which is to develop data-driven, dynamical complex systems models of disaster resilience. Data-driven complex systems modeling approaches could overcome the drawbacks of static measures and allow us to quantitatively model the dynamic recovery trajectories and intrinsic resilience characteristics of communities in a generic manner by leveraging large-scale and granular observations. This approach brings a paradigm shift in modeling the disaster resilience process and its linkage with the recovery process, paving the way to answering important questions for policy applications via counterfactual analysis and simulations.},

The Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of the patient is an interesting measure to investigate this disease to have the prognosis of the disease. This paper proposes a deep learning-based FVC-Net architecture to predict the progression of the disease from the patient's computed tomography (CT) scan and the patient's metadata. The input to the model combines the image score generated based on the degree of honeycombing for a patient identified based on segmented lung images and the metadata. This input is then fed to a 3-layer net to obtain the final output. The performance of the proposed FVC-Net model is compared with various contemporary state-of-the-art deep learning-based models, which are available on a cohort from the pulmonary fibrosis progression dataset. The model showcased significant improvement in the performance over other models for modified Laplace Log-Likelihood (-6.64). Finally, the paper concludes with some prospects to be explored in the proposed study.},

As a preventive measure, proper crowd monitoring and management systems are required to be installed in public places to limit sudden outbreaks and impart improved healthcare. The number of new infections can be significantly reduced by adopting social distancing measures earlier. Motivated by this notion, a real-time crowd monitoring and management system for social distance classification is proposed in this research paper. In the proposed system, people are segregated from the background using the YOLO v4 object detection technique, and then the detected people are tracked by bounding boxes using the Deepsort technique. This system significantly helps in COVID-19 prevention by social distance detection and classification in public places using surveillance images and videos captured by the cameras installed in these places. The performance of this system has been assessed using mean average precision (mAP) and frames per second (FPS) metrics. It has also been evaluated by deploying it on Jetson Nano, a low-cost embedded system. The observed results show its suitability for real-time deployment in public places for COVID-19 prevention by social distance monitoring and classification.},

   abstract = {Low rates of vaccination, emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2, and increasing transmission relating to seasonal changes leave many U.S. communities at risk for surges of COVID-19 during the winter and spring of 2022 that might strain hospital capacity, as in previous waves. The trajectories of COVID-19 hospitalizations during this period are expected to differ across communities depending on their age distributions, vaccination coverage, cumulative incidence, and adoption of risk mitigating behaviors. Yet, existing predictive models of COVID-19 hospitalizations are almost exclusively focused on national- and state-level predictions. This leaves local policymakers in urgent need of tools that can provide early warnings about the possibility that COVID-19 hospitalizations may rise to levels that exceed local capacity. In this work, we develop simple decision rules to predict whether COVID-19 hospitalization will exceed the local hospitalization capacity within a 4- or 8-week period if no additional mitigating strategies are implemented during this time. These decision rules use real-time data related to hospital occupancy and new hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, and when available, genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. We showed that these decision rules present reasonable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (all >=80%) in predicting local surges in hospitalizations under numerous simulated scenarios, which capture substantial uncertainties over the future trajectories of COVID-19 during the winter and spring of 2022. Our proposed decision rules are simple, visual, and straightforward to use in practice by local decision makers without the need to perform numerical computations.Significance Statement In many U.S. communities, the risk of exceeding local healthcare capacity during the winter and spring of 2022 remains substantial since COVID-19 hospitalizations may rise due to seasonal changes, low vaccination coverage, and the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as the omicron variant. Here, we provide simple and easy-to-communicate decision rules to predict whether local hospital occupancy is expected to exceed capacity within a 4- or 8-week period if no additional mitigating measures are implemented. These decision rules can serve as an alert system for local policymakers to respond proactively to mitigate future surges in the COVID-19 hospitalization and minimize risk of overwhelming local healthcare capacity.Competing Interest StatementThis work was partially funded by a Yale School of Public Health COVID-19 Rapid Response Grant to RY.

   abstract = {Inverse problems in computational imaging seek to recover an unknown image of interest from observed measurements acquired using a known forward model. These inverse problems are often ill-conditioned, requiring some form of regularization. The corresponding objective function for inverse problems in computational imaging can often be solved using iterative optimization approaches that alternate between two sub-problems that enforce data consistency and promote the regularization approach, respectively. Such inverse problems arise in a multitude of imaging modalities, in particular in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is the main application area for this thesis. Lengthy scan times remain a challenge in MRI, thus accelerating MRI scans has remained an open research problem over decades. Conventional accelerated MRI techniques acceleration rate is limited by noise amplification and residual artifacts. Recently, deep learning has emerged as an alternative approach for accelerated MRI. Among deep learning techniques, physics-guided deep learning (PG-DL) has drawn great interest, as it incorporates the known physical forward model into the network architecture. PG-DL unrolls a conventional iterative algorithm for solving a regularized least squares problem for a fixed number of iterations, and replaces the proximal operation corresponding to the regularizer implicitly with neural networks. These unrolled networks are trained end-to-end, with the goal of minimizing the difference between the network output and the corresponding reference data. Most of the existing deep learning approaches in MRI reconstruction are based on supervised learning, which requires ground-truth/fully-sampled data for training. However, acquisition of fully-sampled data is infeasible in many applications due to physiological constraints, such as organ motion, or physical constraints, such as signal decay. In several other scenarios, such as high-resolution anatomical brain imaging, it is impractical to acquire fully-sampled datasets as the scan time becomes extremely lengthy. Therefore, enabling the training of PG-DL reconstruction without fully-sampled data is essential for the integration of deep learning reconstruction into clinical MRI practice.The present thesis introduces novel frameworks to enable the training of deep learning reconstruction methods for inverse imaging problems in the absence of ground-truth/fully-sampled data. First, we introduce self-supervised learning via data undersampling (SSDU) approach to enable database training without fully-sampled data. Succinctly, SSDU partitions available measurements into two disjoint sets. One of these sets is used in the data consistency units of the unrolled network, while the other is used to define the loss in the measurement domain. Subsequently, we extend SSDU for processing 3D datasets and provide solutions for GPU memory constraints and data scarcity issues faced in 3D processing. To cope with potential performance degradation at very high acceleration rates, we develop a multi-mask self-supervised learning approach, which retrospectively splits available measurements into multiple 2-tuples of disjoint sets to perform training and define a loss function. Furthermore, we introduce a zero-shot self-supervised learning approach to enable training from a single scan/sample without any external training databases. ZS-SSL partitions the available measurements from a single scan into three disjoint sets. Two of these sets are used to enforce data consistency and define loss during training for self-supervision, while the last set serves to self-validate, establishing an early stopping criterion. Finally, we introduce a self-supervised learning algorithm for referenceless image denoising. Self-supervised deep learning algorithms split the pixels for each image into two disjoint sets to perform training and defining loss. In existent self-supervised denoising approaches which are purely data-driven, the set of pixels used as input to the network is not re-utilized in the end-to-end training since the network is only comprised of a neural network. Reusing the pixels within the network would promote consistency with acquired measurements, thus leading to a more robust and improved denoising performance. To tackle this challenge, we build upon existent self-supervised learning algorithms and recast the denoising problem into a regularized image inpainting framework which allows use of algorithm unrolling for denoising.},

Education is one of the areas most affected by the COVID-imposed abhorrence to physical (i.e., face-to-face (F2F)) communication. Consequently, schools, colleges, and universities worldwide have been forced to transition to different forms of online and virtual learning. Unlike F2F classes where the instructors could monitor and adjust lessons and content in tandem with the learners’ perceived emotions and engagement, in online learning environments (OLE), such tasks are daunting to undertake. In our modest contribution to ameliorate disruptions to education caused by the pandemic, this study presents an intuitive model to monitor the concentration, understanding, and engagement expected of a productive classroom environment. The proposed apposite OLE (i.e., AOLE) provides an intelligent 3D visualisation of the classroom atmosphere (CA), which could assist instructors adjust and tailor both content and instruction for maximum delivery. Furthermore, individual learner status could be tracked via visualisation of his/her emotion curve at any stage of the lesson or learning cycle. Considering the enormous emotional and psychological toll caused by COVID and the attendant shift to OLE, the emotion curves could be progressively compared through the duration of the learning cycle and the semester to track learners’ performance through to the final examinations. In terms of learning within the CA, our proposed AOLE is assessed within a class of 15 students and three instructors. Correlation of the outcomes reported with those from administered questionnaires validate the potential of our proposed model as a support for learning and counselling during these unprecedentedtimes that we find ourselves.},

Hence, in this paper, we propose a weakly supervised image segmentation algorithm. It trains a decision curve from decision graphs of a few sample imbalanced images by SVM and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which is effective for identifying the sparse region of an imbalanced image. Besides, RangeTree is applied to accelerate RDP for large images due to the high complexity of DPeaks Clustering. Experiments prove that the proposed algorithm works well on imbalanced image data sets, not only it can recognize main things, but also has the ability to identify some relatively small objects.},

   abstract = {Background: We aimed to explore the value of early improvement in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) along with potential imaging changes after treatment with paroxetine in building diagnostic models and predicting treatment response. Methods: The clinical symptoms of patients with OCD were assessed at baseline and post-treatment (four weeks). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) indicator, support vector machine (SVM), support vector regression (SVR), and correlation analysis were performed to acquire and analyze the data. Results: In comparison with healthy controls, OCD patients at baseline had abnormal fALFF in several brain regions. The abnormal fALFF in the left precuneus/ posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (r = −0.526, p = 0.001) and right middle cingulate cortex (MCC) (r = −0.588, p < 0.001) were negatively correlated with the severity of compulsions. Patients with OCD showed significantly clinical improvement along with significantly decreased fALFF in the left precuneus after treatment. The SVM analysis showed that the classifier had an accuracy of 90.00% based on the fALFF in the right precentral gyrus and right MCC at baseline. The SVR analysis showed that the actual remission of OCD was positively correlated with the predicted remission based on the fALFF in the left precuneus/PCC and right MCC at baseline. Limitations: This monocentric study with the relatively small sample size might restrict the generalizability of the results to other centers. Conclusions: Abnormal spontaneous neural activities in patients with OCD could serve as potential neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of early treatment response.},

Unfortunately, despite being trained on enormous datasets, most current models have poor performance rates when evaluated against anonymous data from new users. Furthermore, due to the limits and problems of working with human users, capturing adequate data for each new user is not feasible. This paper presents semi-supervised adversarial learning using the LSTM (Long-short term memory) approach for human activity recognition. This proposed method trains annotated and unannotated data (anonymous data) by adapting the semi-supervised learning paradigms on which adversarial learning capitalizes to improve the learning capabilities in dealing with errors that appear in the process. Moreover, it adapts to the change in human activity routine and new activities, i.e., it does not require prior understanding and historical information. Simultaneously, this method is designed as a temporal interactive model instantiation and shows the capacity to estimate heteroscedastic uncertainty owing to inherent data ambiguity. Our methodology also benefits from multiple parallel input sequential data predicting an output exploiting the synchronized LSTM. The proposed method proved to be the best state-of-the-art method with more than 98% accuracy in implementation utilizing the publicly available datasets collected from the smart home environment facilitated with heterogeneous sensors. This technique is a novel approach for high-level human activity recognition and is likely to be a broad application prospect for HAR.},

Existing methods mainly model the mental states of the post speaker implicitly. They also lack the ability to mentalise for complex mental state reasoning. Besides, they are not designed to explicitly capture class-specific features. To resolve the above issues, we propose a mental state Knowledge–aware and Contrastive Network (KC-Net). In detail, we first extract mental state knowledge from a commonsense knowledge base COMET, and infuse the knowledge using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to explicitly model the mental states of the speaker. Then we propose a knowledge–aware mentalisation module based on dot-product attention to accordingly attend to the most relevant knowledge aspects. A supervised contrastive learning module is also utilised to fully leverage label information for capturing class-specific features. We test the proposed methods on a depression detection dataset Depression_Mixed with 3165 Reddit and blog posts, a stress detection dataset Dreaddit with 3553 Reddit posts, and a stress factors recognition dataset SAD with 6850 SMS-like messages. The experimental results show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all datasets: 95.4% of F1 scores on Depression_Mixed, 83.5% on Dreaddit and 77.8% on SAD, with 2.07% average improvement. Factor-specific analysis and ablation study prove the effectiveness of all proposed modules, while UMAP analysis and case study visualise their mechanisms. We believe our work facilitates detection and analysis of depression and stress on social media data, and shows potential for applications on other mental health conditions.},

   abstract = {In recent years, federated learning (FL) has attracted a lot of attention as a new edge computing paradigm for artificial intelligence (AI). FL facilitates multiple edge devices to collaboratively train a global model without leaking local data of any participant. In a typical edge computing scenario, the participants in FL are heterogeneous and can be composed of personal computers, smartphones, Internet of Things devices, network devices, etc.. In this heterogeneous setting, the slowest client in each training round becomes the bottleneck, which may limit the overall convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. To address this issue, one possible solution is to outsource the computing task in the slowest client to faster devices, which requires data transmission from the slowest client to other selected clients. Certainly, sending the original data set is not an option due to the privacy requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient linear coded federated learning (LCFL) framework to (1) speed up the convergence speed of heterogeneous FL and (2) protect the data privacy of the participants. Within the proposed framework, we design a collaborative client selection (CCS) algorithm that can select appropriate clients and assign the computation task of the slowest client to those selected devices. Finally, we build a practical experimental platform and conduct numerous experiments to evaluate the proposed LCFL framework from different aspects. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LCFL scheme can reduce the training time up&nbsp;to 93.73% when the participants have a large difference in terms of computing capability.},

   abstract = {Background: Controlling the epidemic spread and establishing the immune barrier in a short time through accurate vaccine demand prediction and optimised vaccine allocation strategy are still urgent problems to be solved under the condition of frequent virus mutations. Methods: A cross-regional Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed dynamic model was used for scenario simulation to systematically elaborate and compare the effects of different cross-regional vaccine allocation strategies on the future development of the epidemic in regions with different population sizes, prevention and control capabilities, and initial risk levels. Furthermore, the trajectory of the cross-regional vaccine allocation strategy, calculated using a particle swarm optimisation algorithm, was compared with the trajectories of other strategies. Results: By visualising the final effect of the particle swarm optimisation vaccine allocation strategy, this study revealed the important role of prevention and control (including the level of social distancing control, the speed of tracking and isolating exposed and infected individuals, and the initial frequency of mask-wearing) in determining the allocation of vaccine resources. Most importantly, it supported the idea of prioritising control in regions with a large population and low initial risk level, which broke the general view that high initial risk needs to be given priority and proposed that outbreak risk should be firstly considered instead. Conclusions: This is the first study to use a particle swarm optimisation algorithm to study the cross-regional allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. These data provide a theoretical basis for countries and regions to develop more targeted and sustainable vaccination strategies.KEY MESSAGE The innovative combination of particle swarm optimisation and cross-regional SEIR model to simulate the pandemic trajectory and predict the vaccine demand helped to speed up and stabilise the construction of the immune barrier, especially faced with new virus mutations. We proposed that priority should be given to regions where it is possible to prevent more infections rather than regions where it is at high initial risk, thus regional outbreak risk should be considered when making vaccine allocation decisions. An optimal health-oriented strategy for vaccine allocation in the COVID-19 pandemic is determined considering both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical policy interventions, including speed of isolation, degree of social distancing control, and frequency of mask-wearing.},

Methods A multi-disciplinary panel of doctors and IT experts from Asia, the United States, and Europe analyzed published articles regarding expert consensus on the Medical Internet of Things, with reference to study results in the field of metaverse technology. Findings It is feasible to implement the three basic functions of the MIoT, namely, comprehensive perception, reliable transmission, and intelligent processing, by applying a metaverse platform, which is composed of AR and VR glasses and the MIoT system, and integrated with the technologies of holographic construction, holographic emulation, virtuality-reality integration, and virtuality-reality interconnection. In other words, through interactions between virtual and real cloud experts and terminal doctors, we will be able to carry out medical education, science popularization, consultation, graded diagnosis and treatment, clinical research, and even comprehensive healthcare in the metaverse. The interaction between virtual and real cloud experts and terminal users (including terminal doctors, patients, and even their family members) could also facilitate different medical services, such as disease prevention, healthcare, physical examination, diagnosis and treatment of diseases, rehabilitation, management of chronic diseases, in-home care, first aid, outpatient attendance, consultation, etc. In addition, it is noteworthy that security is a prerequisite for the Metaverse in Medicine, and a reliable security system is the foundation to ensure the normal operation of such a platform. Conclusion The application of a Cloud Plus Terminal platform could enable interaction between virtual and real cloud experts and terminal doctors, in order to realize medical education, science popularization, consultation, graded diagnosis and treatment, clinical research, and even comprehensive healthcare in the metaverse.},

   abstract = {There are two important barriers to increasing the employment of older workers under rapid technological change. First, older workers engaged in codifiable, routine tasks are particularly prone to the risk of being displaced by computers and robots. Second, several countries have in place various labour market institutions that encourage early retirement, such as exceptional entitlements or looser criteria for unemployment and disability benefits applied to older individuals. We present evidence that these two factors reinforce each other to push older workers out of employment. We find that older workers who are more exposed to digital technologies face a higher risk of exiting employment and that this effect is significantly magnified when they are eligible for an extension of unemployment benefits until the earliest age for drawing old age pension. Furthermore, we present a simple simulation to illustrate that a policy reform that tightens the eligibility for the benefits extension increases mostly the employment of older workers that are more exposed to digital technologies. Our findings provide an important implication on policies to promote longer working lives under rapid technological change. They highlight the importance of closing institutional pathways to early retirement to encourage employers and older workers to make the necessary investment that would allow older workers to keep up with technological change and work longer.},

   abstract = {Background: In the present COVID-19 crisis, one of the greatest challenges for research funding at both the international and national level is selecting the best research topic to achieve efficiency and equity in health research and to address the knowledge gap urgently raised due to the event. Despite international recommendations, countries should consider their context-specific situation and define local research priorities. We aimed to exercise a priority-setting activity to identify the knowledge gaps and suggest research priorities in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Methods: First, we tried to identify the contextual knowledge gaps based on an online survey, performing key informant interviews (i.e. health professionals, policy-makers and managers) and media analysis. We also performed a literature review and considered international research priorities for COVID-19. Subsequently, we prepared a list of research questions and challenges to respond to the COVID-19 crisis in Iran using a systems approach. Then we mapped approved COVID-19 research projects in the country to research questions. Finally, we compared the identified research questions (not challenges) with the prioritized research from international organizations and then prioritized them for Iran. Results: We found risk factors and epidemiological dissemination patterns of the virus and its consequences in an epidemiology domain, implementation of clinical and hygiene in a clinical management domain, genetic studies for targeting prevention and treatment in a candidate treatment and vaccine research and development (R&D) knowledge domain, examination of the manifestations of ethics in society instead of ethics in research in an ethics domain, “care, access and health system” and “public health and participation in response to public health and clinical research” as two sub-domains of a social sciences domain, and finally, no new questions in either the virology, transmission, diagnosis or animal and environmental domain. Conclusions: In the event of global health crises like COVID-19, prioritization of research questions can be done globally, but some of the research priorities are context-specific and may vary by regional needs. To better manage research resources, researchers must respond to the challenges faced in each country based on its political, economic, social and cultural characteristics, and to make evidence-informed decisions, global knowledge gaps must be customized in each country.},

   abstract = {The world is currently experiencing an ongoing pandemic of an infectious disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (i.e., COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Computed Tomography (CT) plays an important role in assessing the severity of the infection and can also be used to identify those symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. With a surge of the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients, radiologists are increasingly stressed to examine the CT scans manually. Therefore, an automated 3D CT scan recognition tool is highly in demand since the manual analysis is time-consuming for radiologists and their fatigue can cause possible misjudgment. However, due to various technical specifications of CT scanners located in different hospitals, the appearance of CT images can be significantly different leading to the failure of many automated image recognition approaches. The multi-domain shift problem for the multi-center and multi-scanner studies is therefore nontrivial that is also crucial for a dependable recognition and critical for reproducible and objective diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, we proposed a COVID-19 CT scan recognition model namely coronavirus information fusion and diagnosis network (CIFD-Net) that can efficiently handle the multi-domain shift problem via a new robust weakly supervised learning paradigm. Our model can resolve the problem of different appearance in CT scan images reliably and efficiently while attaining higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

Using suites of datasets relating to population, house prices, and built environment development, the nature of gentrification's mutations and its spatial patterns are extracted through a multi-stage data dimensionality reduction and classification methodology.

   abstract = {With the advanced wireless technologies and emerging machine learning techniques, there is an increasing trend of using both wireless communication and machine learning along with new platooning control as well as traffic signal control (TSC) algorithms to leverage and accommodate connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) for achieving high throughput and low latency traffic flow, lowering accidents, and reducing emissions in urban transportation. However, this development leads to highly connected wireless environments that would increase the potential for cyber-attacks on TSC. These attacks can undermine the benefits of new TSC algorithms. For example, an adversary can first perform reconnaissance to gain understanding of how the TSC operates under different traffic arrival rates, and then, choose a fixed number of vehicles to be attack vehicles to get scheduling priority and/or to create traffic congestion in one intersection which can spread to the entire network. These attacks can compromise TSC systems and significantly increase traffic delay and make TSC completely ineffective. Furthermore, machine learning based TSC approaches also lead to several issues: complexity, dimensionality, and convergence. They require a long period of time and a significant amount of training data to gain insights into improvement of traffic throughput and latency. They are not applicable to problems with a large state size. In addition, some of the approaches adopting neural networks (NNs) as a function approximator leads to a convergence issue due to the non-linearity of NNs. In this work, we have proposed the SecureTLC to address the security and machine learning issues caused by the novel technologies for modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS).As our first work, we have investigated security vulnerabilities in four different backpressure-based (BP-based) traffic control algorithms: 1) Delay-based BackPressure Control (DBPC), 2) Queue-based BackPressure Control (QBPC), 3) Sum-of-delay-based BackPressure Control (SBPC), and 4) Hybrid-based BackPressure Control (HBPC) which is a combination of the delay-based and queue-based. Their performance has been compared when they are under two misinformation attacks: 1) time spoofing attack and 2) ghost vehicle attack. The time spoofing attack is a type of falsified data attack in which attack vehicles arriving at an intersection alter their arrival times. In the ghost vehicle attack, attack vehicles intentionally disconnect the wireless communication and thereby hide from the TSC. We have shown that the misinformation sent by attack vehicles can influence the signal phases determined by BP-based traffic control algorithms. We have considered an adversary that determines a set of arriving vehicles to be attack vehicles from many candidate sets (attack strategies) in order to maximize the number of disrupted signal phases. We have shown that by formulating the problem as a 0/1 Knapsack problem, the adversary can explore the space of attack strategies and determine the optimal strategy that maximally compromises the performance in terms of average delay and fairness. Through detailed simulation analyses we have also shown that while the DBPC has better fairness, it is more vulnerable to time spoofing attacks than the other schemes. On the other hand, the QBPC, which determines traffic signal phases using the aggregate queue information, suffers from a higher intensity of ghost vehicle attacks. We have examined the drawbacks of both the DBPC and QBPC under different attack scenarios for different traffic patterns including homogeneous and non-homogeneous vehicle arrivals at an isolated intersection. We have proposed two protection mechanisms against the attacks, namely, an auction-based protection algorithm (APA) and a hybrid-based protection algorithm (HPA). Using simulation analysis, we have shown that both protection schemes are able to mitigate the impacts of the time spoofing and ghost vehicle attacks.In our second work, we have studied the impact of AI-enabled platooning control on fuel consumption. Nowadays, vehicular emissions and traffic congestion have been deteriorated by highly urbanization. The worsen traffic burdens drivers with a higher cost and longer time on driving, and exposures pedestrians to unhealthy emissions such as PM, NOx, SO2 and greenhouse gases. In response to these issues, CAV which enables information sharing between drivers and infrastructure was proposed. With advanced wireless technologies offering extremely low latency and CAV, platooning control can be realized to improve traffic efficiency and safety. However, conventional platooning control algorithms require complex computations and hence, are not a perfect candidate when applying to real-time operations. To overcome this issue, this chapter focuses on designing an innovative learning framework for platooning control capable of reducing the fuel consumption by the four basic platoon manipulations, e.g., split, acceleration, deceleration, and no-op. We integrated reinforcement learning (RL) with NNs to be able to model non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs for a complex application. The experimental results reveal a decreasing trend of the fuel usage and a growing trend of the reward. They demonstrate that the proposed DRL platooning control optimizes the fuel consumption by fine-tuning speeds and sizes of platoons.In our third work, we have applied advanced machine learning techniques to TSC. A recent report has illustrated that an urban road network equipped with an advanced TSC system is capable of reducing average sojourn time of vehicles, traffic collisions, and traffic delay while at the same time decreasing energy consumption and improving parking. Modern TSC systems which leverage advanced machine learning techniques and scheduling algorithms have been a promising topic in recent years. RL has been broadly adopted in many areas, owing to its flexibility in combining an assortment of architectures and neural networks that assists RL agents in learning from a complex environment. Due to its compatibility with numerous existing deep learning techniques, RL can be integrated into a complicated deep learning framework which is extendable and powerful for many deterministic and nondeterministic applications. We proposed a deep RL (DRL) framework which has high extendability and flexibility by incorporating various RL-based algorithms and techniques. We shown that learning performance can be significantly improved by applying an on-policy temporal-difference (TD) learning method, SARSA, to the traffic signal control problem for a traffic network consisting of multiple intersections. The proposed traffic flow maps (TFMs) as input states are formulated by traffic flows at every time slot in the network. These states are fed into a non-linear function approximator to output the optimal action. In order to process TFMs, we combined a convolutional neural network, a dueling network architecture which enhances evaluations of action values when there is a huge action space, and a memory replay that breaks the strong temporal correlations among states. Moreover, we compared learning performance among DQN, 3DQN, DSARSA, and 2DSARSA as well as provide a thorough analysis on their weaknesses and strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work discussing and evaluating learning effects of different DRL-based agents.In our fourth work, as an extended work, we have proposed a novel architecture exploiting both the global and local information to further improve the performance of TSC in the third work. We use the proposed TFMs as input states to represent the global information for a DRL agent and pressure-of-the-lanes (POL) to represent the local information as pressure metric for a number of backpressure (BP) controllers. We define a combinatorial reward function using the power metric which maximizes the overall throughput and minimizes the average end-to-end delay of a network. We proposed a hybrid-based two-level control (TLC) architecture which has high extendability and flexibility by enabling a collaboration between the centralized DRL agent using TFM and the decentralized BP controllers using POL in a hierarchical architecture to determine traffic signal phases that optimizes the network throughput and latency. We show that learning performance can be significantly improved by the collaboration between the two levels for a traffic network of multiple intersections. Moreover, we compare learning performance of the proposed TLC with BP, DQN, 3DQN, DSARSA, and 2DSARSA as well as provide a thorough analysis on their weaknesses and strengths.As our future work, first, we plan to analyze the impacts of malicious attacks on TSC equipped with the DRL-based agent. From our experiments, we have shown that DRL performs well for a traffic network with multiple intersections. We expect to explore the tolerance of DRL-based agent when it is under adversarial attacks. How many attacks can it tolerate? We want to examine the resilience of DRL-based agent as well. How well can it recover after encountering attacks? Second, as we start to consider TSC problems for larger areas, increases in dimensions of states and actions are foreseeable. High dimensional states and actions causing difficulty in learning will be a worthy research topic. We plan to design a two-level control architecture which is capable of reducing the dimension of actions by transferring some workload from a centralized agent to local controllers.},

   abstract = {Background: Blocklisting malicious activities in health care is challenging in relation to access control in health care security practices due to the fear of preventing legitimate access for therapeutic reasons. Inadvertent prevention of legitimate access can contravene the availability trait of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability triad, and may result in worsening health conditions, leading to serious consequences, including deaths. Therefore, health care staff are often provided with a wide range of access such as a ``breaking-the-glass'' or ``self-authorization'' mechanism for emergency access. However, this broad access can undermine the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive health care data because breaking-the-glass can lead to vast unauthorized access, which could be problematic when determining illegitimate access in security practices. Objective: A review was performed to pinpoint appropriate artificial intelligence (AI) methods and data sources that can be used for effective modeling and analysis of health care staff security practices. Based on knowledge obtained from the review, a framework was developed and implemented with simulated data to provide a comprehensive approach toward effective modeling and analyzing security practices of health care staff in real access logs. Methods: The flow of our approach was a mapping review to provide AI methods, data sources and their attributes, along with other categories as input for framework development. To assess implementation of the framework, electronic health record (EHR) log data were simulated and analyzed, and the performance of various approaches in the framework was compared. Results: Among the total 130 articles initially identified, 18 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thorough assessment and analysis of the included articles revealed that K-nearest neighbor, Bayesian network, and decision tree (C4.5) algorithms were predominantly applied to EHR and network logs with varying input features of health care staff security practices. Based on the review results, a framework was developed and implemented with simulated logs. The decision tree obtained the best precision of 0.655, whereas the best recall was achieved by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm at 0.977. However, the best F1-score was obtained by random forest at 0.775. In brief, three classifiers (random forest, decision tree, and SVM) in the two-class approach achieved the best precision of 0.998. Conclusions: The security practices of health care staff can be effectively analyzed using a two-class approach to detect malicious and nonmalicious security practices. Based on our comparative study, the algorithms that can effectively be used in related studies include random forest, decision tree, and SVM. Deviations of security practices from required health care staff's security behavior in the big data context can be analyzed with real access logs to define appropriate incentives for improving conscious care security practice.},

The model accounts for asymptomatic infections as well as the lag between symptom onset and the confirmation date of infection. To reflect the transmission potential of an infected case, we derive the basic reproduction number from the proposed model. Using the daily reported number of confirmed cases, we describe an estimation procedure for the model parameters, which involves adapting the iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) algorithm. To illustrate the use of the proposed model, we examine the COVID-19 data from Quebec for the period from 2 April 2020 to 10 May 2020 and carry out sensitivity studies under a variety of assumptions.

However, the real industry implementation of the integrated approach has been challenging. Even separately, both Lean and Industry 4.0 have high failure rates. Understanding these implementations is essential to increase the application's success and build a bridge between academia and industry. This research uses a systematic literature review methodology to identify case studies that integrate the implementation of lean principles with Industry 4.0 technology. The benefits, barriers, and success factors of the integration were investigated, focusing on environmental, social, and operational perspectives. Forty-two case studies that included lean principles and Industry 4.0 technology in the manufacturing context were identified. The integration resulted in various operational benefits regarding lead-time, throughput, and quality. In terms of environmental impact, there is a potential to estimate the use of resources involved in the production and reduce CO2 emissions. Other benefits include improved employee welfare, better communication, employee empowerment. The main barrier is the investment cost followed by technological readiness. It has been concluded that Lean and Industry 4.0 present considerable potential. However, the integration needs proper understanding on how to start, where to aim, what to be aware of.},

   abstract = {The rapid expansions of urban rail networks are faced with the growing number of disruptions caused by the complex rail signaling systems, incorrect driving behaviors, and extreme weather. Since urban rail systems are inherently complex and many of these disruptions are usually uncertain and inevitable, the rail managers have gradually paid more attention to the ability to withstand and quickly recover. Nevertheless, only a small number of recent developments have tried to address the ability of an urban rail system to recover from disruptions while considering the inherent structures. In this work, we propose a hybrid knowledge-based and data-driven approach for quantitative analysis of resilience. The aim is to model the causal relationships to quantify the importance of different perturbations to the overall resilience criteria. A set of key features related to the risk assessment and system resilience are summarized according to the historical data in Beijing Metro. Then, we develop a training procedure based on the structure of BN and historical data. Finally, we embed this hybrid approach into software that is applied to Beijing Metro. The results demonstrate the quantitative relationships between system resilience and different types of events.},

   abstract = {Importance: Due to the evolving variants of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is important to understand the relationship between the disease condition and socioeconomic, demo-graphic, and health indicators across regions. Background: Studies examining the relationships between infectious disease and socioeconomic variables are not yet well established. Design: A total of 3042 counties in the United States are included as the observation unit in the study. Two outcome variables employed in the study are the control of disease spread and infection prevalence rates in each county. Method: Data are submitted to quantile regression, hierarchical regression, and random forest analyses to understand the extent to which health outcomes are affected by de-mographics, socioeconomics, and health indicators. Results: Counties with better control of the disease spread tend to have lower infection rates, and vice versa. When measuring different outcome variables, the common risk factors for COVID-19 with a 5% level of statistical significance include employment ratio, female labor ratio, young population ratio, and residents’ average health risk factors, while protective factors include land size, housing value, travel time to work, female population ratio, and ratio of residents who identify themselves as mixed race. Conclusions: The implications of the findings are that the ability to maintain social distancing and personal hygiene habits are crucial in deterring disease transmission and lowering incidence rates, especially in the early stage of disease formation. Relevant authorities should identify preventive factors and take early actions to fight infectious diseases in the future.},

This study focuses on techniques used for the multi-label classification of medical text. Using the information published by the United Kingdom NHS and the World Health Organisation, we present a novel approach to predicting COVID-19 patient shielding as a multi-label classification problem. We use publicly available, de-identified ICU medical text data for our experiments. The labels are derived from the published COVID-19 patient shielding data. We present an extensive comparison across 12 multi-label classifiers from the simple binary relevance to neural networks and the most recent transformers. To the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study, where such a range of multi-label classifiers for medical text are considered. We highlight the benefits of various approaches, and argue that, for the task at hand, both predictive accuracy and processing time are essential.},

   abstract = {Hypernasality is a disorder where excess nasal resonance is perceived during speech, often as a result of abnormal coupling between the oral and nasal tracts known as velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). The most common cause of VPI is a cleft palate, which affects around 1 in 1650 babies, around ⅓ of whom have persistent speech problems after surgery. Current equipment-based assessment methods are invasive and require expert knowledge, and perceptual assessment methods are limited by the availability of expert listeners and differing interpretations of assessment scales. Spectral analysis of hypernasality within the academic community has resulted in potentially useful spectral indicators, but these are highly variable, vowel specific, and not commonly used within clinical practice. Previous works by others have developed noise excitation technologies for the measurement of oral tract transfer functions using resonance measurement devices (RMD). These techniques provide an opportunity to investigate the structural system abnormalities which lead to hypernasality, without the need for invasive measurement equipment. Thus, the work presented in this study adapts these techniques for the detection of hypernasality. These adaptations include augmentation of the hardware and development of the software, so as to be suitable for transfer function measurement at the nostrils rather than the mouth (nRMD). The new method was tested with a single participant trained in hypernasal production, producing ‘normal’ and hypernasal vowels, and the recordings validated through a listening test by an expert listener and calculation of nasalance values using a nasality microphone. These validation stages indicated the reliability of the captured data, and analysis of the nRMD measurements indicated the presence of a systematic difference in the frequency range 2 to 2.5 kHz between normal and hypernasal speech. Further investigation is warranted to determine the generalisability of these findings across speakers, and to investigate the origins of differences manifesting in the transfer functions between conditions. This will provide new insights into the effects of nasal tract coupling on voice acoustics, which could in turn lead to the development of useful new tools to support clinicians in their work with hypernasality.},

   abstract = {Background: Topic modeling of patient medication reviews of erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs can help identify patient preferences regarding ED treatment options. The identification of a set of topics important to the patient from social network service drug reviews would inform the design of patient-centered medication counseling. Objective: This study aimed to (1) identify the distinctive topics from patient medication reviews unique to tadalafil versus sildenafil; (2) determine if the primary topics are distributed differently for each drug and for each patient characteristic (age and time on ED drug therapy); and (3) test if the primary topics affect satisfaction with ED drug therapy controlling for patient characteristics. Methods: Data were collected from the patient medication reviews of sildenafil and tadalafil posted on WebMD and Ask a Patient. The latent Dirichlet allocation method of natural language processing was used to identify 5 distinctive topics from the patient medication reviews on each drug. Analysis of variance and a 2-sample t test were conducted to compare the topic distribution and assess whether patient satisfaction varies with the primary topics, age, and time on medication for each ED drug. Statistical significance was tested at an alpha of .05. Results: The patient medication reviews of sildenafil (N=463) had 2 topics on treatment benefit and 1 each on medication safety, marketing claim, and treatment comparison, while the patient medication reviews of tadalafil (N=919) had 2 topics on medication safety and 1 each on the remaining subjects. Sildenafil's reviewers quite frequently (94/463, 20.4%) mentioned erection sustainability as their primary topic, whereas tadalafil's reviewers were more concerned about severe medication safety. Those who mentioned erection sustainability as their primary topic were quite satisfied with their treatment as opposed to those who mentioned severe medication safety as their primary topic (score 3.85 vs 2.44). The discovered topics reflected the marketing claims of blue magic and amber romance for sildenafil and tadalafil, respectively. The topic of blue magic was preferred among younger patients, while the topic of amber romance was preferred among older patients. The topic alternative choices, which appeared for both the ED drugs, reflected patient interest in the comparative effectiveness and price outside the drug labeling information. Conclusions: The patient medication reviews of ED drugs reflect patient preferences regarding drug labeling information, marketing claims, and alternative treatment choices. The patient preferences concerning ED treatment attributes inform the design of patient-centered communication for improved ED drug therapy.},

   abstract = {Data modelling and analysis have become a recent trend in medical and healthcare applications for their ease of visualization and handling. To keep up with the vast amount of information generated by such medical and healthcare applications, the need for computer-aided modelling and intelligent data handling is expected to increase the quality of assessment and visualization. Moreover, reliable modelling requires structured data handling for achieving better data visualization. The un-ordered and raw disease/medical data require formal structuring and grouping for improving the visualization process. Existing models consume too much time for processing a huge volume of data. This, in turn, causes a high error rate in classification, which directly affects system performance. In this paper, biosensors gather patient health information and examine the infectious with a high prediction rate. A biosensor rapidly collects patient health data changes and reduces the time complexity of data modelling and analysis. Moreover, a supervised Non-Variant Structuring (NVS) approach for grouping infectious disease data is introduced. This approach helps improve the visualization of sensor-based acquired raw data. In this structuring process, the associativity and disparity features of the infectious disease data are identified for grouping and analyzing the disease-related features. The introduced structuring method employs a supervised learning technique for identifying the associativity and disparity in different instances of accumulation based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This learning technique reduces the chances of non-partial organization of infectious disease data for better modelling and analysis. The performance of the suggested approach is verified with a sensitivity ratio of 98.2%, a specificity ratio of 96.7%, and accuracy ratio of 95.5%, a prediction error rate of 7.8% less, and a classification time of 10.1% less compared to other existing methods.},

However, extracting the relevant information for different types of situational awareness has been challenging. Existing studies have investigated classifications of crisis information on social media, but not much focus has been put on the classification of pandemic related information. Pandemics are public health related crisis that present unique characteristics. We propose to classify pandemic tweets from three perspectives, i.e., informativeness, geographic view, and information source, after a comprehensive analysis of the factors determining the relevance of information to situational awareness. The joint use of three-faceted classifications will enable the identification of relevant data for multiple purposes of situational awareness. We manually annotate a dataset with COVID-19 tweets and explore multi-task learning models for the classification of three tasks simultaneously. The proposed multi-task neural network models show improved performance compared with single learning models. We also find that pretraining multi-task models with relevant crisis datasets can further boost the performance. Specifically, multi-task models can significantly increase the recall of ‘informative’ and ‘local’ tweets, which are important for local response actions and policy decision making.},

To quantify and track the ongoing contributions of GPH to the COVID-19 response, the Office of Genomics and Precision Public Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created the COVID-19 Genomics and Precision Health database (COVID-19 GPH), an open access knowledge management system and publications database that is continuously updated through machine learning and manual curation.

The database also includes articles describing applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence to the investigation and control of COVID-19 (28%). COVID-GPH represents about 10% (22983/221241) of the literature on COVID-19 on PubMed.

We compared these virological attributes of this new variant of concern (VOC) with those of the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in a Syrian hamster model of COVID-19. Omicron-infected hamsters lost significantly less body weight and exhibited reduced clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine and chemokine dysregulation, and lung damage than Delta-infected hamsters. Both variants were highly transmissible through contact transmission. In noncontact transmission studies Omicron demonstrated similar or higher transmissibility than Delta. Delta outcompeted Omicron without selection pressure, but this scenario changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies—active against Delta but poorly active against Omicron—was introduced. Next-generation vaccines and antivirals effective against this new VOC are therefore urgently needed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

   abstract = {Mass vaccination is one of the most effective epidemic control measures. Because ones vaccination decision is shaped by social processes, the pattern of vaccine uptake tends to show strong social and spatial heterogeneity, such as urban-rural divide and clustering. Examining through network perspectives, we develop a framework for estimating the impact of spatial vaccination heterogeneity on epidemic outbreaks. Leveraging fine-grained mobility data and computational models, we investigate two network effectsthe hub effect (vaccinating mobility hubs reduces transmission) and the homophily effect (stronger homophily in vaccination rates increases transmission). Applying Bayesian deep learning and fine-grained epidemic simulations, our study suggests a negative effect of homophily and a positive effect of highly vaccinated hubs on reducing case counts for both the synthetic network and the U.S. mobility network. Our framework enables us to evaluate outcomes from various hypothetical spatial vaccine distributions and to study a hypothetical vaccination campaign strategy that targets a small number of regions with the largest gain in protective power using the data from January 2022. Our simulation suggests that our strategy can potentially prevent about 2.5 times more cases than a uniform strategy with an additional 1% of the population vaccinated. Notably, our simulation also shows that this strategy could even better protect vulnerable or disadvantaged communities through network effects than strategies that directly target them. Our study suggests that we need to examine the interplay between vaccination patterns and mobility networks beyond the overall vaccination rate, and that understanding geographical pattern of vaccine uptake could be just as important as improving the overall vaccination rate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research is supported by Purdue Krannert School of Management and MIT Connection Science.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The source data is available from Safegraph https://www.safegraph.Acom/academicsI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

   abstract = {The shift towards digitalization in education, intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic-related issues, has led to the emergence of a need to expand the borders of the teaching profession. To be effective in the digital environment, school teachers have to master new transprofessional competences (TPCs), enabling them to use the skill sets of other careers, gain new skills and abilities and find non-standard solutions to professional and pedagogical problems using digital technologies. This study investigated education employers’ opinions (61 principals and deputy principals from 31 Russian secondary schools) about the comparative importance of TPCs for school teachers working in the digital environment and their perceptions of what barriers prevent teachers from developing TPCs. The survey used a three-item questionnaire asking the respondents to rank the TPCs and the TPC clusters in order of importance for teachers working with the digital and to describe the obstacles to teachers’ TPC development. The findings revealed that the employers attached the greatest importance to psychological TPCs while assigning the least importance to digital citizenship TPCs. The major barriers to TPC development, in the respondents’ opinion, lay in teachers’ fear of new trends and their excessive workload. Based on the survey results, we designed a model of school teachers’ transprofessional competences in digital teaching and learning that can be used as an assessment tool in different professional settings. The paper concludes with suggestions on how to overcome the barriers and help improve school teachers’ TPC development.},

Design, Setting, and Participants This prognostic study evaluated prospective predictions for a cohort of patients with metastatic solid tumors seen in outpatient oncology clinics at a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center and associated satellites between December 6, 2019, and August 6, 2021. Oncologists (57 physicians and 17 advanced practice clinicians) answered a 3-month surprise question (3MSQ) within clinical pathways. A model was trained with electronic health record data from January 1, 2013, to April 24, 2019, to identify patients at high risk of 3-month mortality and deployed silently in October 2019. Analysis was limited to oncologist prognostications with a model prediction within the preceding 30 days. Exposures Three-month surprise question and gradient-boosting binary classifier. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was performance comparison between oncologists and the model to predict 3-month mortality. The primary performance metric was the positive predictive value (PPV) at the sensitivity achieved by the medical oncologists with their 3MSQ answers. Results A total of 74 oncologists answered 3099 3MSQs for 2041 patients with advanced cancer (median age, 62.6 [range, 18-96] years; 1271 women [62.3%]). In this cohort with a 15% prevalence of 3-month mortality and 30% sensitivity for both oncologists and the model, the PPV of oncologists was 34.8% (95% CI, 30.1%-39.5%) and the PPV of the model was 60.0% (95% CI, 53.6%-66.3%). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model was 81.2% (95% CI, 79.1%-83.3%). The model significantly outperformed the oncologists in short-term mortality. Conclusions and Relevance In this prognostic study, the model outperformed oncologists overall and within the breast and gastrointestinal cancer cohorts in predicting 3-month mortality for patients with advanced cancer. These findings suggest that further studies may be useful to examine how model predictions could improve oncologists' prognostic confidence and patient-centered goal-concordant care at the end of life.},

   abstract = {The lungs are COVID-19’s most important focus, as it induces inflammatory changes in the lungs that can lead to respiratory insufficiency. Reducing the supply of oxygen to human cells negatively impacts humans, and multiorgan failure with a high mortality rate may, in certain circumstances, occur. Radiological pulmonary evaluation is a vital part of patient therapy for the critically ill patient with COVID-19. The evaluation of radiological imagery is a specialized activity that requires a radiologist. Artificial intelligence to display radiological images is one of the essential topics. Using a deep machine learning technique to identify morphological differences in the lungs of COVID-19-infected patients could yield promising results on digital images of chest X-rays. Minor differences in digital images that are not detectable or apparent to the human eye may be detected using computer vision algorithms. This paper uses machine learning methods to diagnose COVID-19 on chest X-rays, and the findings have been very promising. The dataset includes COVID-19-enhanced X-ray images for disease detection using chest X-ray images. The data were gathered from two publicly accessible datasets. The feature extractions are done using the gray level co-occurrence matrix methods. K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, linear discrimination analysis, naïve Bayes, and convolutional neural network methods are used for the classification of patients. According to the findings, convolutional neural networks’ efficiency linked to imaging modalities with fewer human involvements outperforms other traditional machine learning approaches.},

   abstract = {With confusion and uncertainty ruling the world, 2020 created near-perfect conditions for cybercriminals. As businesses virtually eliminated in-person experiences, the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way we live and caused a mass migration to digital platforms. However, this shift also made people more vulnerable to cyber-crime. Victims are being targeted by attackers for their credentials or financial rewards, or both. This is because the Internet itself is inherently difficult to secure, and the attackers can code in a way that exploits its flaws. Once the attackers gain root access to the devices, they have complete control and can do whatever they want. Consequently, taking advantage of highly unprecedented circumstances created by the Covid-19 event, cybercriminals launched massive phishing, malware, identity theft, and ransomware attacks. Therefore, if we wish to save people from these frauds in times when millions have already been tipped into poverty and the rest are trying hard to sustain, it is imperative to curb these attacks and attackers. This paper analyses the impact of Covid-19 on various cyber-security related aspects and sketches out the timeline of Covid-19 themed cyber-attacks launched globally to identify the modus operandi of the attackers and the impact of attacks. It also offers a thoroughly researched set of mitigation strategies which can be employed to prevent the attacks in the first place. Moreover, this manuscript proposes a fuzzy logic and data mining-based intelligence system for detecting Covid-19 themed malicious URL/phishing attacks. The performance of the system has been evaluated against various malicious/phishing URLs, and it was observed that the proposed system is a viable solution to this problem.},

As a result, social media platforms have always had a difficult time authenticating this fake information. Different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) classifiers were used in this work to categorize the continuing impacts of tweets and forecast their after-effects. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) were used for classification, while AdaBoost and convolutional neural network (CNN) were utilized for future effects. The tweets dataset from Kaggle was used to train the SVM, RF, KNN, and DT models, which were then assessed on multiple evaluation criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, using a 70 : 30 ratio. The CNN and AdaBoost, on the other hand, have been taught to detect the mean square error, root mean square error, and mean absolute error. With 0.74 and 0.73 percent score out of 1, respectively, RF and SVM exhibit the best accuracy in impact when classifying the outcomes on the obtained dataset.

This study aims to characterize PASC using the EHR data warehouses from two large national patient-centered clinical research networks (PCORnet), INSIGHT and OneFlorida+, which include 11 million patients in New York City (NYC) and 16.8 million patients in Florida respectively. With a high-throughput causal inference pipeline using high-dimensional inverse propensity score adjustment, we identified a broad list of diagnoses and medications with significantly higher incidence 30-180 days after the laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to non-infected patients. We found more PASC diagnoses and a higher risk of PASC in NYC than in Florida, which highlights the heterogeneity of PASC in different populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Agreement OTA HL161847-01 (contract number EHR-01-21) as part of the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) research program.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study used two large-scale de-identified real-world EHR datasets from the INSIGHT Clinical Research Network (CRN)15 and the OneFlorida+ CRN16.

   abstract = {Previous studies of construction contract auction bidding have mainly focused on finding factors affecting the markup and decision to bid (d2b), without considering expert weight and critical factors as input variables for estimating the size of markup needed. This study develops a 3-step Mamdani-type of Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) identifying critical factors and predicting markups for construction projects. The first step models the wights of 31 construction experts based on their characteristics (i.e., experience and academic qualifications). The second step models frequency, severity, and importance weights for each factor to find the rank and priority of the factors, revealing the critical factors to be current workload, project (contract) size, need for work, availability of labor and staff required, project owner, and duration. The third step takes the importance weight of each factor from the previous step and the contractor's evaluation of the frequency of the factors as input variables to predict the bid markup. The model is demonstrated and tested with two actual construction projects having actual markups of 20% and 45%, and the predicted markups are found to be 26.3% and 42% respectively, which ensures reliable outcomes in assessing contractors’ bidding decisions. It is a novel model that can simultaneously identify critical factors and predict an optimal markup in assisting contractors’ d2b for the construction auctions and developing risk management plans. Future research can optimize this model by incorporating competitors’ bids and enhancing prediction accuracy to guarantee the lowest price with a reasonable profit margin.},

The execution of a power-hungry learning task at energy-constrained devices is a key challenge confronting the implementation of FEEL.

To derive guidelines on deploying the resultant <italic>wirelessly powered FEEL</italic> (WP-FEEL) system, this work aims at the derivation of the tradeoff between the model convergence and the settings of power sources in two scenarios: 1) the transmission power and density of power-beacons (dedicated charging stations) if they are deployed, or otherwise 2) the transmission power of a server (access-point). The development of the proposed analytical framework relates the accuracy of distributed stochastic-gradient estimation to the WPT settings, the randomness in both communication and WPT links, and devices’ computation capacities. Furthermore, the local-computation at devices (i.e., mini-batch size and processor clock frequency) is optimized to efficiently use the harvested energy for gradient estimation. The resultant learning-WPT tradeoffs reveal the simple scaling laws of the model-convergence rate with respect to the transferred energy as well as the devices’ computational energy efficiencies. The results provide useful guidelines on WPT provisioning to yield a guaranteer on learning performance. They are corroborated by experimental results using a real dataset.},

The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated travel mode choice behavior in terms of shared mobility, but the evidence on this impact is limited. To fill this gap, this paper first designs a stated preference survey to collect mode choice data before and during the pandemic. Different shared mobility services are considered, including ride hailing, ride sharing, car sharing, and bike sharing. Then, latent class analysis is used to divide the population in terms of their attitudes toward shared mobility. Nested logit models are applied to compare travel mode choice behavior during the two periods. The results suggest that shared mobility has the potential to avoid the high transmission risk of public transport and alleviate the intensity of private car use in the COVID-19 context, but this is limited by anxiety about shared spaces. As the perceived severity of the pandemic increases, preference for ride hailing and ride sharing decreases, and a price discount for ride hailing is more effective than that for ride sharing at maintaining the ridership despite the impact of COVID-19. These findings contribute to understanding the change in travel demand and developing appropriate strategies for shared mobility services to adapt to the pandemic.},

Signs of progress have been achieved but are still limited. This paper intends to prove the existence of at least three genomic signature patterns and at least seven subtypes of COVID-19 driven by five critical genes (the smallest subset of genes). These signatures and subtypes provide crucial genomic information in COVID-19 diagnosis (including ICU patients), research focuses, and treatment methods. Unlike existing approaches focused on gene fold-changes and pathways, gene-gene nonlinear and competing interactions are the driving forces in finding the signature patterns and subtypes. Furthermore, the method leads to 100% accuracy, which shows biological and mathematical equivalences between COVID-19 status and the signature patterns and a methodological advantage over other existing methods that cannot lead to 100% accuracy. As a result, as new biomarkers, the new findings can be much more informative than other findings for interpreting biological mechanisms, developing the second (third) generation of vaccines, antiviral drugs, and treatment methods, and eventually bringing new hopes to an end of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The probability of exposure to risk events is generally low, making the test process extremely time-consuming. To address this, we proposed a surrogate-based method in scenario-based simulation test to expediate the assessment of the risk rate of HAVs. HighD data were used to fit the naturalistic distribution and to estimate the probability of each concrete scenario. Machine learning model-based surrogates were proposed to quickly approximate the test result of each concrete scenario. Considering the different capabilities and domains of various surrogate models, we applied six surrogate models to search for two types of targeted scenarios with different risk levels and rarity levels. We proved that the performances of different surrogate models greatly distinguish from each other when the target scenarios are extremely rare. Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) was the most efficient surrogate model, which could achieve risk rate assessment with only 2.5% test resources. The required CPU runtime of IDW was 2% of that required by Kriging. The proposed method has great potential in accelerating the risk assessment of HAVs.},

   abstract = {The traditional object (person) retrieval (re-identification) task aims to learn a discriminative feature representation with intra-similarity and inter-dissimilarity, which supposes that the objects in an image are manually or automatically pre-cropped exactly. However, in many real-world searching scenarios (e.g., video surveillance), the objects (e.g., persons, vehicles, etc.) are seldom accurately detected or annotated. Therefore, object-level retrieval becomes intractable without bounding-box annotation, which leads to a new but challenging topic, i.e., image-level search with multi-task integration of joint detection and retrieval. In this paper, to address the image search issue, we first introduce an end-to-end Integrated Net (I-Net), which has three merits: 1) A Siamese architecture and an on-line pairing strategy for similar and dissimilar objects in the given images are designed. Benefited by the Siamese structure, I-Net learns the shared feature representation, because, on which, both object detection and classification tasks are handled. 2) A novel <bold>o</bold>n-<bold>l</bold>ine <bold>p</bold>airing (OLP) loss is introduced with a dynamic feature dictionary, which alleviates the multi-task training stagnation problem, by automatically generating a number of negative pairs to restrict the positives. 3) A <bold>h</bold>ard <bold>e</bold>xample <bold>p</bold>riority (HEP) based softmax loss is proposed to improve the robustness of classification task by selecting hard categories. The shared feature representation of I-Net may restrict the task-specific flexibility and learning capability between detection and retrieval tasks. Therefore, with the philosophy of <bold>d</bold>ivide and <bold>c</bold>onquer, we further propose an improved I-Net, called DC-I-Net, which makes two new contributions: 1) two modules are tailored to handle different tasks separately in the integrated framework, such that the task specification is guaranteed. 2) A class-center guided HEP loss (C<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">^2</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="zhang-ieq1-3009758.gif"></inline-graphic></alternatives></inline-formula>HEP) by exploiting the stored class centers is proposed, such that the intra-similarity and inter-dissimilarity can be captured for ultimate retrieval. Extensive experiments on famous image-level search oriented benchmark datasets, such as CUHK-SYSU dataset and PRW dataset for person search and the large-scale WebTattoo dataset for tattoo search, demonstrate that the proposed DC-I-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art tasks-integrated and tasks-separated image search models.},

Current researches usually focus on a deeper or wider neural network for COVID-19 recognition. And the implicit contrastive relationship between different samples has not been fully explored. To address these problems, we propose a novel model, called deep contrastive mutual learning (DCML), to diagnose COVID-19 more effectively. A multi-way data augmentation strategy based on Fast AutoAugment (FAA) was employed to enrich the original training dataset, which helps reduce the risk of overfitting. Then, we incorporated the popular contrastive learning idea into the conventional deep mutual learning (DML) framework to mine the relationship between diverse samples and created more discriminative image features through a new adaptive model fusion method. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the DCML model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines. More importantly, DCML is easier to reproduce and relatively efficient, strengthening its high practicality.},

However, ranking the native ligand binding pockets from a pool of predicted pockets is still a hard task for computational molecular biologists using a single web-based tool. Hence, we believe, by using closer to real application data set as training and by providing ligand information, an enhanced model to identify accurate pockets can be obtained. In this article, we propose a new deep learning method called DeepBindPoc for identifying and ranking ligand-binding pockets in proteins. The model is built by using information about the binding pocket and associated ligand. We take advantage of the mol2vec tool to represent both the given ligand and pocket as vectors to construct a densely fully connected layer model. During the training, important features for pocket-ligand binding are automatically extracted and high-level information is preserved appropriately. DeepBindPoc demonstrated a strong complementary advantage for the detection of native-like pockets when combined with traditional popular methods, such as fpocket and P2Rank. The proposed method is extensively tested and validated with standard procedures on multiple datasets, including a dataset with G-protein Coupled receptors. The systematic testing and validation of our method suggest that DeepBindPoc is a valuable tool to rank near-native pockets for theoretically modeled protein with unknown experimental active site but have known ligand. The DeepBindPoc model described in this article is available at GitHub (https://github.com/haiping1010/DeepBindPoc) and the webserver is available at (http://cbblab.siat.ac.cn/DeepBindPoc/index.php).},

   abstract = {Predicting protein properties from amino acid sequences is an important problem in biology and pharmacology. Protein–protein interactions among SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, human receptors and antibodies are key determinants of the potency of this virus and its ability to evade the human immune response. As a rapidly evolving virus, SARS-CoV-2 has already developed into many variants with considerable variation in virulence among these variants. Utilizing the proteomic data of SARS-CoV-2 to predict its viral characteristics will, therefore, greatly aid in disease control and prevention. In this paper, we review and compare recent successful prediction methods based on long short-term memory (LSTM), transformer, convolutional neural network (CNN) and a similarity-based topological regression (TR) model and offer recommendations about appropriate predictive methodology depending on the similarity between training and test datasets. We compare the effectiveness of these models in predicting the binding affinity and expression of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences. We also explore how effective these predictive methods are when trained on laboratory-created data and are tasked with predicting the binding affinity of the in-the-wild SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences obtained from the GISAID datasets. We observe that TR is a better method when the sample size is small and test protein sequences are sufficiently similar to the training sequence. However, when the training sample size is sufficiently large and prediction requires extrapolation, LSTM embedding and CNN-based predictive model show superior performance.},

   abstract = {Deep learning is an artificial intelligence technique in which models express geometric transformations over multiple levels. This method has shown great promise in various fields, including drug development. The availability of public structure databases prompted the researchers to use generative artificial intelligence models to narrow down their search of the chemical space, a novel approach to chemogenomics and de novo drug development. In this study, we developed a strategy that combined an accelerated LSTM_Chem (long short-term memory for de novo compounds generation), dense fully convolutional neural network (DFCNN), and docking to generate a large number of de novo small molecular chemical compounds for given targets. To demonstrate its efficacy and applicability, six important targets that account for various human disorders were used as test examples. Moreover, using the M protease as a proof-of-concept example, we find that iteratively training with previously selected candidates can significantly increase the chance of obtaining novel compounds with higher and higher predicted binding affinities. In addition, we also check the potential benefit of obtaining reliable final de novo compounds with the help of MD simulation and metadynamics simulation. The generation of de novo compounds and the discovery of binders against various targets proposed here would be a practical and effective approach. Assessing the efficacy of these top de novo compounds with biochemical studies is promising to promote related drug development.},

   abstract = {Background: Depression is a common debilitating mental disorder caused by various factors. Identifying and diagnosing depression are challenging because the clinical evaluation of depression is mainly subjective, lacking objective and quantitative indicators. The present study investigated the value and significance of eye movement measurements in distinguishing depressed patients from controls. Methods: Ninety-five depressed patients and sixty-nine healthy controls performed three eye movement tests, including fixation stability, free-viewing, and anti-saccade tests, and eleven eye movement indexes were obtained from these tests. The independent t-test was adopted for group comparisons, and multiple logistic regression analysis was employed to identify diagnostic biomarkers. Support vector machine (SVM), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and Bayesian (BYS) algorithms were applied to build the classification models. Results: Depressed patients exhibited eye movement anomalies, characterized by increased saccade amplitude in the fixation stability test; diminished saccade velocity in the anti-saccade test; and reduced saccade amplitude, shorter scan path length, lower saccade velocity, decreased dynamic range of pupil size, and lower pupil size ratio in the free-viewing test. Four features mentioned above entered the logistic regression equation. The classification accuracies of SVM, QDA, and BYS models reached 86.0%, 81.1%, and 83.5%, respectively. Conclusions: Depressed patients exhibited abnormalities across multiple tests of eye movements, assisting in differentiating depressed patients from healthy controls in a cost-effective and non-invasive manner.},

   abstract = {Existing stereo matching methods achieve satisfactory average accuracy on a whole predicted disparity map under common global metrics, but ignore the fine-grained performance at region level, especially for far regions in the scene, which is more crucial in actual auto-driving scenarios. There are two factors accounting for this problem: 1) Depth resolution. Existing methods use disparity-based sampling to extract matching candidates uniformly according to the disparity range, but leads to sparser sampling density at far regions than that of close regions in terms of depth range, resulting in low depth resolution in far regions. 2) Feature discriminability. Limited image resolution and inferior feature extraction at far regions result in the obtained features with low discrimination, which influences the subsequent matching process between stereo images. To improve the estimation accuracy of far regions and thus achieve a balanced performance at region level, we design a novel two-stage Balanced Stereo Matching Network (BSMNet) to address the above problems. The coarse stage of BSMNet introduces a direct depth-based sampling strategy, which generates matching candidates according to scene depth instead of disparity, thus improving the depth resolution and obtaining initial depth map with more balanced accuracy. Then, a depth refinement stage is proposed to solve the problem of low feature discriminability and further optimizes the initial depth map obtained from the coarse stage. It selects matching candidates and computes their similarity scores from a carefully designed adaptive feature volume guided by a learnable scale map, thus making the final estimation more accurate. Different from the existing methods that construct stereo matching based on disparity prediction, our proposed pipeline is to directly optimize on depth information. Experiments show that our BSMNet can obtain an obvious performance improvement at far regions without discarding that at close regions, so as to largely outperform existing state-of-the-art methods.},

   abstract = {Wearable-based human activity recognition is well-studied in the machine learning and pervasive computing community. A large corpus of studies focused on using wearable sensors to recognize health-related behaviors that involve high periodicity in the sensed signal, such as sitting, walking, and running. Other activities that occur less frequently throughout the day, such as eating gestures pose an even more significant challenge. One challenge in recognizing these activities or gestures within continuous sensor signals is that of spotting these activities amid irrelevant data in a user-independent manner. Many existing machine learning models are trained to spot these activities, yet yield a large number of false positives, impacting the feasibility of these wearable devices in longitudinal studies. Moreover, many machine learning models are designed without consideration to the limited computational resources of the wearable device, compromising the utility of the models in detecting behavior in real-time. In this research, I focus on spotting sporadic activities that are infrequent throughout the day and considered health-related behaviors, namely, chewing to understand problematic eating behaviors and coughing for respiratory disease diagnostics and assessment, which were further magnified risk behaviors during the Covid-19 pandemic. To address the detection of these human behaviors, I propose a wrist-worn sensor-based feeding gesture detection system that detects overeating behavior using a novel motif-based data fusion algorithm. I then present a neck-worn multi-sensor wearable system equipped with a peak-based segmentation machine learning pipeline to allow reliable chewing detection in free-living settings. Finally, I propose and demonstrate a novel multi-centroid classifier to resolve the on-device challenge of cough detection using a computationally limited earbud platform.},

   abstract = {Online assessment is the key issue of studying online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Often, online assessments are understood as the mirror to face-to-face learning assessments. In fact, online assessment should start from the premise that all interactive learning strategies are assessment strategies, and as such should be considered for their value in measuring the experiences of students and instructors. This study used the phenomenological method of qualitative research through in-depth interviews with 14 college students and 6 instructors. Based on this, it explored the perception of online assessment in Macao higher learning institutions from the complementary perspectives of college students and instructors, and constructed a theoretical model. The main research findings are that after the assessment shifted from offline to online, some new features appeared, and corresponding changes in form and function occurred. Formally, online assessment is manifested as single subjectivity and flexible diversity, which leads to the assessment dilemma of lack of constructive alignment. At the same time, the functions of assessment have also been extended and even alienated. So the effect of online assessment is not satisfactory. The recommendations for the development of the technological environment and the changes of formative and summative assessment are also discussed in this paper. In terms of the technological environment, efforts need to be made to provide more authentic online learning experiences with synchronous feedback and flexible interaction. In order to help develop a holistic person with online learning, which is the ultimate goal of learning, corresponding criterion-referenced assessment and functions of assessment should be improved accordingly to promote student learning while considering students’ recognition and facilitate the co-construction of knowledge between instructors and students. In addition, future research can focus on the development of the readiness of assessment technology, as well as the form and purpose of assessment. Overall, this study provides a more comprehensive understanding of online learning and assessment from the dual perspectives of instructors and students, which could help further studies in this field.},

In recent years, specialized methods of artificial intelligence and large-scale data analysis have been used to make faster and simpler detection of violations of international regulations on the use of banned substances. The smart systems in question depend directly on the quality of the data used, as high-quality data will produce algorithmic approaches of correspondingly high quality and accuracy. It is evident that there are many sources of errors in data collections and intentional algorithmic interventions that may result from cyber-attacks, so end-users of artificial intelligence technologies should be able to know the exact origins of data and analytical methods of these data at an algorithmic level. Given that artificial intelligence systems based on incomplete or discriminatory data can lead to inaccurate results that violate the fundamental rights of athletes, this paper presents an advanced model for mitigating bias and error in machine learning to protect sports data, using convolutional neural network (ConvNet) with high-precise class activation maps (HiPrCAM).

In this study, we developed a joint allocation model for allocating testing and treatment resources with consideration of their time-lag correlation to minimize the loss of patients and maximum the fairness of allocation in all regions. We devised a sequential solution generation strategy (SSGS) and combined it with the NSGA2 and MOPSO algorithms to solve the proposed joint allocation problem. We demonstrated numerically that NSGA2 coupled with SSGS yields a better solution. Furthermore, we compared the solutions of our joint allocation model with those of an independent allocation model. Our numerical results show that the joint allocation scheme, which considers the time-lag correlation between the two types of resources, has better performance—with a lower loss of patients and higher fairness of allocation. In particular, when the impact of the allocation of testing resources on the demand for treatment resources was increased, the joint allocation scheme performed better in terms of both the objectives.},

However, most of research does not fully explore the molecular structures of drug compounds in DTI prediction. To this end, we propose a deep learning model to capture the molecular structure information of drug compounds for DTI prediction. This model utilizes a transformer network incorporating multilayer graph information, which captures the features of a drug's molecular structure so that the interactions between atoms of drug compounds can be explored more deeply. At the same time, a convolutional neural network is employed to capture the local residue information in the target sequence, and effectively extract the feature information of the target. The experiments on the DrugBank dataset showed that the proposed model outperformed previous models based on the structure of target sequences. The results indicate that the improved transformer network fuses the feature information between layers in the graph convolutional neural network and extracts the interaction data for the molecular structure. The drug repositioning experiment on COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the proposed model's ability to find therapeutic drugs in drug discovery.

   abstract = {Prognosis is crucial for tracking and predicting a system's performance and provides the basis for predictive maintenance. Prognosis techniques are broadly classified into model-based and data-driven methods, which rely on physical knowledge and data learning, respectively. While data-driven methods alleviate limitations associated with model-based methods due to assumptions needed to simplify system complexity, they generally require a large amount of training data to properly capture the system behavior and make the models generalizable. This study addresses these issues by presenting a physics-guided Gaussian process (PGGP) that integrates physical knowledge with data learning in three aspects: (1) analytical equations, which model the physical degradation trend, are embedded as the mean function of Gaussian process (GP) to guide the prognosis; (2) kernel functions of GP are designed to model the time-varying variation in degradation; (3) the parameters of physical mean function and kernel functions are jointly optimized through data learning to capture the information not embedded in existing physical knowledge. Evaluated using a dataset of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, PGGP has consistently achieved higher prediction accuracy as compared to data-driven methods without embedded physics, including standard GP, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), by at least 11.4%, 31.7% and 5.0%, respectively. In addition, PGGP has demonstrated improved data efficiency, outperforming standard GP, SVM and RNN by up to 59.9%, 75.5% and 68.4%, respectively, in the scenario of the least amount of training data, which is critical to ensuring early forecast of system degradation and support predictive maintenance.},

   abstract = {Objective: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed the capacity of healthcare resources and posed a challenge for worldwide hospitals. The ability to distinguish potentially deteriorating patients from the rest helps facilitate reasonable allocation of medical resources, such as ventilators, hospital beds, and human resources. The real-time accurate prediction of a patient's risk scores could also help physicians to provide earlier respiratory support for the patient and reduce the risk of mortality. Methods: We propose a robust real-time prediction model for the in-hospital COVID-19 patients' probability of requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). The end-to-end neural network model incorporates the Multi-task Gaussian Process to handle the irregular sampling rate in observational data together with a self-attention neural network for the prediction task. Results: We evaluate our model on a large database with 9,532 nationwide in-hospital patients with COVID-19. The model demonstrates significant robustness and consistency improvements compared to conventional machine learning models. The proposed prediction model also shows performance improvements in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) compared to various deep learning models, especially at early times after a patient's hospital admission. Conclusion: The availability of large and real-time clinical data calls for new methods to make the best use of them for real-time patient risk prediction. It is not ideal for simplifying the data for traditional methods or for making unrealistic assumptions that deviate from observation's true dynamics. We demonstrate a pilot effort to harmonize cross-sectional and longitudinal information for mechanical ventilation needing prediction.},

   abstract = {Hospitals in Canada are facing a crisis-level shortage of critical supplies and equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This motivates us to create predictive models that can use Canada COVID-19 data and pandemic-related factors to accurately forecast 5 quantities—three related to hospital resource utilization (i.e., the number of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators that will be needed by COVID-19 patients) and two to the pandemic progress (i.e., the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths)—several weeks in advance. We developed a machine learning method that can use information (i.e., resource utilization, pandemic progress, population mobility, weather condition, and public policy) currently known about a region since March 2020, to learn multiple temporal convolutional network (TCN) models every week; each used for forecasting the weekly average of one of these 5 quantities in Canada (respectively, in six specific provinces) for each, in the next 1 (resp., 2,3,4) weeks. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we compared our method, versus other standard models, on the COVID-19 data and hospital resource data, on the tasks of predicting the 116 values (for Canada and its six most populated provinces), every week from Oct 2020 to July 2021, and the 20 values (only for Canada) for four specific times within 9 July to 31 Dec 2021. Experimental results show that our 4640 TCN models (each forecasting a regional target for a specific future time, on a specific date) can produce accurate 1,2,3,4-week forecasts of the utilization of every hospital resource and pandemic progress for each week from 2 Oct 2020 to 2 July 2021, as well as 80 TCN models for each of the four specified times within 9 July and 31 Dec 2021. Compared to other baseline and state-of-the-art predictive models, our TCN models yielded the best forecasts, with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additional experiments, on the IHME COVID-19 data, demonstrate the effectiveness of our TCN models, in comparison with IHME forecasts. Each of our TCN models used a pre-defined set of features; we experimentally validate the effectiveness of these features by showing that these models perform better than other models that instead used other features. Overall, these experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately forecast hospital resource utilization and pandemic progress for Canada and for each of the six provinces.},

   abstract = {Occupancy-based control (OBC) in smart buildings provides numerous potentials to improve building energy efficiency. To achieve effective OBC, the occupancy status of a space or a building needs to be well understood in terms of whether the space is occupied and how many people are in the space. Well-designed and selected people counting technologies are cornerstones for OBC. However, the study and application of such technologies in OBC are relatively new. There are few mature people counting sensors available on the market. In addition, there is a lack of standardized guidance to comprehensively test, evaluate and compare the performance of people counting sensors, which further limits the selection and application of them in OBC. Hence, an innovative testing protocol was developed to fill in the gap. This paper introduces the design of the protocol with eight diversities and discusses case studies that evaluated four representative types of people counting sensors following the proposed protocol. It is found that the protocol can effectively guide a comprehensive evaluation of the selected sensors and lead to informative findings on the sensor performance. The test results can provide insights and suggestions not only for sensor developers to improve the sensor hardware and software design but also for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system designers and building managers to select the proper people counting sensors for OBC design. The test results on the sensor accuracy can also support additional evaluations of integrated OBC and building system operation. It is anticipated that the developed methodology can offer guidance on the test and evaluation of other occupancy sensing technologies.},

The CoEv-Soar-RL uses reinforcement learning and coevolutionary algorithms to improve the functions of a logistics enterprise value chain. We address: (1) holistic prediction, optimization, and simulation for the logistics enterprise readiness; (2) the uncertainty and lack of data which require large-scale systematic what-if scenarios to simulate potential new and unknown situations. In this paper, we perform four experiments to investigate how to integrate prediction and simulation to modify a logistics enterprise's demand models and generate synthetic data based. We use general domain knowledge to design simple operators for the coevolutionary search algorithm that provide realistic solutions for the simulation of the logistic enterprise. In addition, to evaluate generated solutions we learn a surrogate model of a logistic enterprise environment from historical data with Soar reinforcement learning. From our experiments we discover, and verify with subject matter experts, novel realistic solutions for the logistic enterprise. These novel solutions perform better than the historical data and where only found when we include knowledge derived from the historical data in the co-evolutionary search.},

   abstract = {Embedding &amp; MLP has become a paradigm for modern large-scale recommendation system. However, this paradigm suffers from the cold-start problem which will seriously compromise the ecological health of recommendation systems. This paper attempts to tackle the item cold-start problem by generating enhanced warmed-up ID embeddings for cold items with historical data and limited interaction records. From the aspect of industrial practice, we mainly focus on the following three points of item cold-start: 1) How to conduct cold-start without additional data requirements and make strategy easy to be deployed in online recommendation scenarios. 2) How to leverage both historical records and constantly emerging interaction data of new items. 3) How to model the relationship between item ID and side information stably from interaction data. To address these problems, we propose a model-agnostic Conditional Variational Autoencoder based Recommendation(CVAR) framework with some advantages including compatibility on various backbones, no extra requirements for data, utilization of both historical data and recent emerging interactions. CVAR uses latent variables to learn a distribution over item side information and generates desirable item ID embeddings using a conditional decoder. The proposed method is evaluated by extensive offline experiments on public datasets and online A/B tests on Tencent News recommendation platform, which further illustrate the advantages and robustness of CVAR.},

These studies lack considering the evolution of demand patterns or presume fixed interaction structures among multiple destinations, limiting their applications during uncertain times when demands and their interactions could evolve fast. This study simultaneously infers interactions among multiple tourist attractions from tourist arrival data and learns temporal patterns for forecasting short-term tourist arrivals at these attractions.

Given the high number of meetings that were held online during the COVID-19 pandemic, we had an unprecedented opportunity to record extensive meeting data with a newly developed meeting companion application. We analyzed 72 h of conversations from 85 real-world virtual meetings and 256 self-reported meeting success scores. We did so by developing a deep-learning framework that can extract 32 nuanced emotions from meeting transcripts, and by then testing a variety of models predicting meeting success from the extracted emotions. We found that rare emotions (e.g., disappointment and excitement) were generally more predictive of success than more common emotions. This demonstrates the importance of quantifying nuanced emotions to further improve productivity analytics, and, in the long term, employee well-being.},

   abstract = {Unexpectedly frequent severe haze episodes were observed in Beijing during February–March in 2021 after two phases of clean air action plan (2013–2020), yet the causes remained unclear. Here, we conducted real-time fine particle (PM2.5) composition measurements during January–March in 2021 using a time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor and an aethalometer and compared with those during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) period in 2020. Our results showed ubiquitously elevated concentrations of chloride, black carbon (BC), and primary organic aerosol (POA) in 2021, suggesting increased primary emissions during the post-COVID-19 period. By using the machine learning-based random forest (RF) algorithm, we found largely different responses of aerosol changes to meteorology in different months. After decoupling the effects of meteorology, the PM2.5 changes from 2020 to 2021 were reduced from −35.6% to −29.0% in January, −24.1% to −4.5% in February, and +92.6% to +34.2% in March, respectively. Our results demonstrate the dominant roles of stagnant meteorology and secondary production in the formation of severe haze episodes in March 2021. In particular, we found that the compositions of observed and deweathered PM2.5 were fairly similar between 2020 and 2021, and the ratios of secondary OA to secondary inorganic aerosols were close. Our study indicates that decoupling the influence of meteorological conditions is of great importance for better evaluation of mitigating strategies of air pollution due to the large impact of meteorology on the changes in PM2.5 species particularly in a short period.},

   abstract = {The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been a nightmare to citizens, hospitals, healthcare practitioners, and the economy in 2020. The overwhelming number of confirmed cases and suspected cases put forward an unprecedented challenge to the hospital’s capacity of management and medical resource distribution. To reduce the possibility of cross-infection and attend a patient according to his severity level, expertly diagnosis and sophisticated medical examinations are often required but hard to fulfil during a pandemic. To facilitate the assessment of a patient’s severity, this paper proposes a multi-modality feature learning and fusion model for end-to-end covid patient severity prediction using the blood test supported electronic medical record (EMR) and chest computerized tomography (CT) scan images. To evaluate a patient’s severity by the co-occurrence of salient clinical features, the High-order Factorization Network (HoFN) is proposed to learn the impact of a set of clinical features without tedious feature engineering. On the other hand, an attention-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) using pre-trained parameters are used to process the lung CT images. Finally, to achieve cohesion of cross-modality representation, we design a loss function to shift deep features of both-modality into the same feature space which improves the model’s performance and robustness when one modality is absent. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-modality feature learning and fusion model achieves high performance in an authentic scenario.},

   abstract = {Background: Patient-specific lung mechanics during mechanical ventilation (MV) can be identified from measured waveforms of fully ventilated, sedated patients. However, asynchrony due to spontaneous breathing (SB) effort can be common, altering these waveforms and reducing the accuracy of identified, model-based, and patient-specific lung mechanics. Methods: Changes in patient-specific lung elastance over a pressure–volume (PV) loop, identified using hysteresis loop analysis (HLA), are used to detect the occurrence of asynchrony and identify its type and pattern. The identified HLA parameters are then combined with a nonlinear mechanics hysteresis loop model (HLM) to extract and reconstruct ventilated waveforms unaffected by asynchronous breaths. Asynchrony magnitude can then be quantified using an energy-dissipation metric, Easyn, comparing PV loop area between model-reconstructed and original, altered asynchronous breathing cycles. Performance is evaluated using both test-lung experimental data with a known ground truth and clinical data from four patients with varying levels of asynchrony. Results: Root mean square errors for reconstructed PV loops are within 5% for test-lung experimental data, and 10% for over 90% of clinical data. Easyn clearly matches known asynchrony magnitude for experimental data with RMS errors < 4.1%. Clinical data performance shows 57% breaths having Easyn > 50% for Patient 1 and 13% for Patient 2. Patient 3 only presents 20% breaths with Easyn > 10%. Patient 4 has Easyn = 0 for 96% breaths showing accuracy in a case without asynchrony. Conclusions: Experimental test-lung validation demonstrates the method’s reconstruction accuracy and generality in controlled scenarios. Clinical validation matches direct observations of asynchrony in incidence and quantifies magnitude, including cases without asynchrony, validating its robustness and potential efficacy as a clinical real-time asynchrony monitoring tool.},

We also introduce an end-to-end approach based on generative flows to approximate the posterior distribution of time series with exact likelihoods. Our model is powerful as adding stochasticity to different factors (e.g., reservoir capacity and water-flow measurements) and thus overcomes the expressiveness limitations of deterministic prediction methods. It also enables trainable latent transformations that can improve the model interpretability. We evaluate HydroFlow on the data collected from the hydropower stations of a large-scale hydropower development company.

We also design a new visualization method for genome alignments in multiple alignment format to explore the pattern of within and between species variation. Combining these visual representations with prime knowledge, ggmsa assists researchers in discovering MSA and making decisions.

   abstract = {As COVID-19 uproots millions of lives globally, it is crucial to understand the virus's transmission routes. One such route, aerosol transmission, has been largely ignored by global health leaders until recently, despite surmounting evidence supporting its prevalence. Aerosols (droplet nuclei <5 m in diameter) are produced during routine respiratory functions, can remain suspended in the air over prolonged durations and distances and can carry infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles. Thus, it is imperative that universities implement solutions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission in spaces at risk for infectious aerosol buildup, namely enclosed, high-occupancy spaces. This paper investigates the dynamics of SARSCoV-2 aerosol transmission and identifies the best practices that institutions should follow to minimize classroom aerosol transmission. Through reviewing literature on the transmission of several respiratory diseases (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and tuberculosis) and modeling aerosol spread in classroom scenarios using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, this group proposes solutions to minimize SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission. Novel CFD models of two Johns Hopkins University (JHU) classroom spaces analyzed the effects of four variables -- seating arrangement, window opening, door opening, air purifier placement (AP) -- on classroom airflow and identified distinct airflow patterns for different scenarios. Informed by CFD model results and previous literature, suggestions to mitigate aerosol transmission include decreasing class sizes, rearranging students to minimize exposure, opening doors and windows, upgrading HVAC filters, strategically installing portable APs, disinfecting, and implementing behavioral regulations. These solutions can further be generalized to many types of enclosed spaces, with only minor adjustments necessary to account for airflow pattern differences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Online teaching was perceived as useful overall, although challenges existed, such as online interaction, assessment, and hands-on practices. Regarding ease of use in online teaching, instructors perceived technology was easy to use; yet some pedagogical challenges existed, such as class engagement, the focus of learners’ attention, and transforming hands-on lab or clinical sessions online.

   abstract = {Ventilation plays a noteworthy role in maintaining a healthy, comfortable and energy-efficient indoor environment and mitigating the risk of aerosol transmission and disease infection (e.g., SARS-COV-2). In most commercial and office buildings, demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) systems are widely utilized to conserve energy based on occupancy. However, as the presence of occupants is often inherently stochastic, accurate occupancy prediction is challenging. This study, therefore, proposes an autoencoder Bayesian Long Short-term Memory neural network (LSTM) model for probabilistic occupancy prediction, taking account of model misspecification, epistemic uncertainty, and aleatoric uncertainty. Performances of the proposed models are evaluated using real data in an educational building at the University of Cambridge, UK. The models trained on data of one open-plan space are used to predict occupant numbers for other spaces (with similar layout and function) in the same building. The probabilistic occupant profiles are then used for estimating optimal ventilation rates for two scenarios (i.e., normal DCV mode for energy conservation and anti-infection mode for virus transmission prevention). Results show that, during the test period, for the 1-h ahead prediction, the proposed model achieved better performance with up to 5.8% mean absolute percentage error reduction than the traditional LSTM model. More flexible alternatives for ventilation can be offered by the proposed risk-aware decision-making schemes serving different purposes under real operation. The findings from this study provide new occupancy forecasting solutions and explore the potential of probabilistic decision making for building ventilation optimization.},

   abstract = {Background Point-of-care and decentralized testing for SARS-CoV-2 is critical to inform public health responses. Performance evaluations in priority use cases such as contact tracing can highlight trade-offs in test selection and testing strategies.Methods A prospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted among close contacts of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. Two anterior nares swabs (ANS), a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), and saliva were collected at all visits. Vaccination history and symptoms were assessed. Household contacts were followed longitudinally. Three rapid antigen tests and one molecular method were evaluated for usability and performance against reference RT-PCR on NPS.Results Fifty index cases and 214 contacts (64 household) were enrolled. Sixty-five contacts were RT-PCR positive during at least one visit. Vaccination did not influence viral load. Gamma variants were most prevalent; Delta emerged increasingly during implementation. Overall sensitivity of evaluated tests ranged from 33\%\\{\textendash\\}76%. Performance was higher among symptomatic cases and cases with Ct&lt;34 and lower among oligo/asymptomatic cases. Assuming a 24-hour time-to-result for RT-PCR, the cumulative sensitivity of an ANS rapid antigen test was &gt;70% and almost 90% after four days.Conclusions The near immediate time-to-result for antigen tests significantly offsets lower analytical sensitivity in settings where RT-PCR results are delayed or unavailable.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by grants from The Rockefeller Foundation [2020 HTH 039] and Amazon.com [2D-04020007] to GJD.

   abstract = {<p>Retrieved memories of past events are often inaccurate. The scenario construction model (SCM) postulates that during encoding, only the gist of an episode is stored in the episodic memory trace and during retrieval, information missing from that trace is constructed from semantic information. The current study aimed to find behavioural evidence for semantic construction in a realistic, yet controlled setting by introducing a new paradigm and adjusted memory tests that measure semantic construction. Using a desktop virtual reality (VR) participants navigated through a flat in which some household objects appeared in unexpected rooms, creating conflicts between the experienced episode and semantic expectations. The manipulation of congruence enabled us to identify influences from semantic information in cases of episodic memory failure. Besides we controlled for objects to be task-relevant or -irrelevant to the sequence of action. In addition to an established old/new recognition task we introduced spatial and temporal recall measures as possible superior memory measures quantifying semantic construction. The recognition task and the spatial recall revealed, that both congruence and task-relevance predicted correct episodic memory retrieval. In cases of episodic memory failure semantic construction was more likely than guessing and occurred more frequently for task-irrelevant objects. In the temporal recall object-pairs belonging to the same semantic room-category were temporally clustered together compared to object-pairs from different semantic categories (at the second retrieval). Taken together, our findings support the predictions of the SCM. The new VR-paradigm, including the new memory measures appears to be a promising tool for investigating semantic construction.</p>},

   abstract = {Active learning, a subfield of machine learning, can train a good model by selecting a minimum number of labeled samples. In many machine learning scenarios, needed information (such as the best value in unlabeled datasets) is acquired by prediction. When there is too little data in the training model, the prediction accuracy would obviously affect the accuracy of the results. To establish a high-performance regression model for a small dataset while accelerating the search for the best sample, a new active learning query strategy, EGO-ALR, that combines efficient global optimization (EGO) and active learning for regression (ALR) was proposed. It was found that the performance of EGO-ALR was significantly better than the original ALR query strategies in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and opportunity cost (Oppo Cost). Specifically, EGO-ALR increased the Oppo Cost by an average of 25.27% when the RMSE and CC values were not more than 1.07% different from the original ALR. This study validated the efficiency and robustness of EGO-ALR approaches using 19 datasets from various domains and three distinct linear regression models (Ridge regression, Lasso, and Elastic network).},

   abstract = {Background: Congregate settings, such as healthcare clinics, may play an essential role in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission. Using patient and environmental data, we studied transmission at a primary care clinic in South Africa. Methods: We collected patient movements, cough frequency, and clinical data, and measured indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, relative humidity, and Mtb genomes in the air. We used negative binomial regression model to investigate associations. Results: We analyzed 978 unique patients who contributed 14 795 data points. The median patient age was 33 (interquartile range [IQR], 26-41) years, and 757 (77.4%) were female. Overall, median CO2 levels were 564 (IQR 495-646) parts per million and were highest in the morning. Median number of coughs per day was 466 (IQR, 368-503), and overall median Mtb DNA copies/μL/day was 4.2 (IQR, 1.2-9.5). We found an increased presence of Mtb DNA in the air of 32% (95% credible interval, 7%-63%) per 100 additional young adults (aged 15-29 years) and 1% (0-2%) more Mtb DNA per 10% increase of relative humidity. Estimated cumulative transmission risks for patients attending the clinic monthly for at least 1 hour range between 9% and 29%. Conclusions: We identified young adults and relative humidity as potentially important factors for transmission risks in healthcare clinics. Our approach should be used to detect transmission and evaluate infection control interventions.},
